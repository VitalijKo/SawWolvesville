### DAY 2

That night, the kitten-werewolf, player number 9, died at the hands of bandits. The werewolves didn't kill anyone. Medium, on his turn, revived the vigilante.

**12 kill3r:** I'm sorry, 11.

**12 kill3r:** Yeah, I was wrong. There are bandits in the game, not an illusionist. But you were too hard on me about that. You should tone it down and be nicer to players whose opinions you disagree with.

**4 Pandacake:** 6 â‰  10.

**4 Pandacake:** That's right, 4. But to be honest, you were a little out of line yourself.

**8 petit_donuts:** I got the info too. 13 or 16 killed 9.

**12 kill3r:** Are you in your right mind? You're a detective, but I don't see any deduction in you.

**4 Pandacake:** Are you serious? We're in a game, not a damn movie!

**12 kill3r:** What movie? The detective is your role. And you don't just have to use its abilities, you have to fit it.

**4 Pandacake:** OMG.

**12 kill3r:** Can you please tell me your name?

**4 Pandacake:** Why?

**12 kill3r:** If I meet someone with that name, I'll know that very likely he isn't intelligent. Well, her.

**4 Pandacake:** What a bastard you are.

**4 Pandacake:** 6, shoot him for me.

But it was too late. Vigilante revealed the role of player number 10, whose team didn't match his own.

He turned out to be the wolf scribe.

**4 Pandacake:** Perfect.

**4 Pandacake:** Okay. Next one's definitely gonna be 12.

**12 kill3r:** You better hope so.

**4 Pandacake:** So, that makes our vote 10.

**4 Pandacake:** 13 or 16, name your roles.

**13 Linq:** Baker.

**16 kqte:** Headhunter.

**4 Pandacake:** All clear... Well, one of them will have to be checked.

**12 kill3r:** I'm sorry, but could you please use your brain? Why would you check? 13 must have given someone bread. Let him tell us that player's number so he can verify it.

**4 Pandacake:** 13, ANSWER IN 5 SECONDS!!! WHO DID YOU GIVE THE BREAD TO?

**13 linq:** 16...

The detective realized that 13 was probably lying and nothing would save her. She expected her to name a random number or not name anyone. But it was the answer like that that surprised her the most.

**4 Pandacake:** 16, is it true?

Unexpectedly, the girl went offline, so the detective didn't get an answer.

**4 Pandacake:** Damn! Where'd she go?

**12 kill3r:** Internet hang-up? Or someone distracted her?

**1 5w6:** At this exact moment?

**12 kill3r:** I'm glad you've never been in this kind of situation. Otherwise you wouldn't be thinking what you're thinking now.

**1 5w6:** I remember you said 4 to turn her brain on. But that doesn't apply to you. Or do you really not understand anything? Any idiot can see that 13 and 16 are coupled. Nonverbally they have come to an agreement to use the same tactic. It involves creating the illusion that they actually have good roles. They want to frame the sheriff.

**1 5w6:** And the way 12 is defending 16, I can definitely tell they know each other. You can see that even though they are not in the same clan, and any clan at all.

**1 5w6:** Be glad 16 is off. Because your friend is clearly not going to like your behavior.

Vitaly felt the blood inside him boil, his eyes redden and hands begin to shake. The player with the name *5w6* finally made him mad.

**12 kill3r:** Who are you calling an idiot? Did you forget to take your sedatives, you brainless bitch? Where the hell did you come from? Go back to your den and play Roblox, where you don't need a brain.

**12 kill3r:** Do you really think that's true? Then answer me one question.

**12 kill3r:** WHERE IS THEIR THEORY IS THE REAL SHERIFF??? BECAUSE FOR THE VILLAGERS TO BELIEVE THAT 8 IS NOT THE REAL SHERIFF, THEY HAVE TO REALIZE WHO THE REAL ONE IS!!!

**1 5w6:** 9, IDIOT!!!

**16 kill3r:** KITTEN-WEREWOLF???

**1 5w6:** DID YOU FORGET ABOUT 10, DAMN WOFL SCRIBE??? APPARENTLY YOU'RE NOT ONLY SILLY, YOU'RE BLIND!!!

**12 kill3r:** DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND THAT 8 IS THE FAKE SHERIFF??? OR ARE YOU COMPLETELY STUCK IN YOUR PATHETIC FANTASY BECAUSE THERE'S NOTHING INTERESTING IN REAL LIFE???

**8 petit_donuts:** Hey, I'm real!

**12 kill3r:** Nobody's asking for your opinion right now!

**10 enji:** 12, I think you need to calm down a little bit.

**12 kill3r:** Me? And who was the one who insulted her the first day?

**10 enji:** I was just trying to protect myself. That was my tactic.

**12 kill3r:** And I defend EVERYONE from her pathetic provocations! She could be believed! Imagine what would happen then!

**10 enji:** You're too angry with her. All because you don't agree with her opinion.

**12 kill3r:** First of all, I don't disagree. I know that opinion is wrong and you will see that. Second, she acts like she knows everything, including me.

**10 enji:** But are you really playing together with 16?

**12 kill3r:** WHY??? ON WHAT GROUNDS??? TELL ME A GOOD REASON!!! OR I'LL FLEE THE HELL OUT OF THIS VILLAGE, LEAVING IT UNPROTECTED, THUS CONDEMNING THE VILLAGERS TO CERTAIN DEATH!!!

**8 petit_donuts:** I don't know about you, but I reported 12.

**1 5w6:** Me too, obviously.

**4 Pandacake:** Me too.

**12 kill3r:** LOL, I SEE 1 HAS THE ROLE NAMED *"REPORTER"*!!!

**10 enji:** ...

**1 5w6:** Very funny.

When the players fight was over, the detective got down to business.

**4 Pandacake:** There's really only one way to find out who the real sheriff is.

**4 Pandacake:** The medium should ask 9 his real role, unless of course his death was scribed.

**12 kill3r:** Not a bad guess... But useless.

**4 Pandacake:** Why? 

**1 5w6:** OMG, he always talks like that. With his riddles. Even though he doesn't understand anything.

**12 kill3r:** Mouth off, 1.

**12 kill3r:** 4, if 9 is a werewolf, he will still say he was a sheriff to help his team. There's no point in telling the truth for him because no one claims sheriff anymore.

**4 Pandacake:** In that case, see what we do. We lynch 10. There's the guardian wolf in the game, and he can protect him. So if he survives, let him be killed by the witch. But before he does, let him wait a few seconds. I'll check 8 with 10. If she's in the villagers team, she's the real sheriff.

**8 petit_donuts:** I'm speechless. Well, okay, suit yourself.

**4 Pandacake:** I'm sorry, 8, but there are no other options.

At the voting, everyone chose 10.

But someone protected him from execution.
