### DAY 4

**4 Pandacake:** 6 = 7. So 7 is the true medium.

**4 Pandacake:** One more thing. Since 9's death was scribed, I'm really curious, is there actually a bandits in the game, or is the random killer different?

**12 kill3r:** Most likely he's different. Unless the wolf seer found him and saw his role. Otherwise it's extremely unlikely that they randomly guessed his role.

**4 Pandacake:** I hope he's not the cannibal...

**4 Pandacake:** Well, let's summarize. There is one original werewolf, one turned werewolf, and one random killer whose role we still don't know. 3 is cupid, I'm the detective, 6 is the vigilante, 7 is the medium, and 16, if she's telling the truth, is the headhunter. So we have numbers 2, 5, 12, and 14 under suspicion.

**2 zip_:** Like I said, I'm the doctor.

**12 kill3:** Like I said, the doctor is me.

**2 zip_:** That can't be right! And anyway, the detective didn't check you, so you can't counter claim doctor!

**12 kill3r:** So you haven't been checked either.

**4 Pandacake:** I take it rolecall is a useless thing to do... The vigilante used his abilities, and the witch used her killing potion. We have no choice but to lynch one of the players, hoping he lies.

**12 kill3r:** Listen, 4. I have a theory about the random killer.

**4 Pandacake:** What's that?

**12 kill3r:** What if 2 is the headhunter claiming to be the doctor to kill me? And the killer is 16 who is offline all the time, which explains the absence of kills?

**12 kill3r:** I suggest we let her live for the very end. I think she'll flee the village on her own after two days. In the meantime, we'll deal with the unchecked players.

**4 Pandacake:** Good idea! So, next night, I'll check 2.

**12 kill3r:** Great. Finally gonna realize he's not the doctor.

**12 kill3r:** And so, 5 and 14 are unclaimed.

**4 Pandacake:** 5, would you mind naming your role?

**5 Stallius:** Since I don't have any more potions, I claim witch.

**14 Mylk:** I don't think so.

**5 Stallius:** What do you mean?

**14 Mylk:** I'm the real witch. Killed 13 and protected 4.

**5 Stallius:** You're lying! I did it all!

**14 Mylk:** No, it's pretty clear here that 5 is fake.

**5 Stallius:** WHAT DO YOU UNDERSTAND??? HOW DO YOU UNDERSTAND???

**14 Mylk:** Look, look how mad he got.... His plan wasn't working!

**5 Stallius:** ARE YOU AN IDIOT OR *YES*??? I'M THE WITCH!!! YOU PATHETIC LIAR!!!

**14 Mylk:** A little more and he's gonna cry! He's gonna cry!

**5 Stallius:** YOU DUMB BITCH!!! YOU HAVE NO BRAINS!!! SHUT THE HELL UP AND ACCEPT YOUR LOSS, YOU FURRY SLUT!!!

The gong sounded. Slowly but gradually all players voted to lynch 5.

**5 Stallius:** DIM-WITTED SLOW-WITTEDS!!! YOU'RE DUMBER THAN A WORM!!! DUMBER THAN AN OBTUSE ANGLE!!! DUMBER THAN A BLUNT SHOVEL!!! YOU'RE THE DUMBEST IN THE WHOLE WORLD!!!

**5 Stallius:** YOUR BRAINS ARE TOO DUMB TO BE TRUE!!! I'LL BELIEVE IN THE EXISTENCE OF GOD MORE THAN SUCH DUMB BRAINS!!!

**5 Stallius:** I'VE ROCKED YOU ON MY AGGREGATE!!!

For the last seconds of his life, 5 desperately screamed, insulting 14, insulting the village, threatening all the players, and cursing the entire game in general. But the villagers paid no attention to him, and only waited for the end of the voting, calmly watching his slow death.

**5 Stallius:** I REMEMBER YOU ALL!!! AND I WILL KILL EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU IN THE NEXT GAMES!!!

Spewing out one last threat, 5, the guardian wolf, passed away.
