## 1 MONTH AFTER THE EVENTS

<br>

***You know, before I started writing this post, I thought about this situation for a long time. Always when the opportunity presented itself, I wondered if things could have gone differently. Wouldn't all of this have happened if they had forgotten about me? If they hadn't come up with their plan? If she had closed the game on her computer? I kept answering these questions and thinking about what I could have done to change the course of events. But the truth is, no matter how much you do it, you can't go back in time and change things, even if you know how. I lost a friend who was the embodiment of my happiness. And have to suffer intense sadness every day. To ease my plight, I want to pour my heart out in this post.***

***It's been three months since I got banned in Wolvesville for random kills and game ruining.***

***I couldn't stop thinking about my old friends after I lost. And her words kept flashing in my mind. Every night they tormented me and kept me awake.***

***I went insane and obsessed with being better than everyone else. With that I HAD to be the best. But I made it worse. I lost my calculability, and it came down to the fact that I was killing random players, accusing them for fake, and constantly trying to expose everyone as soon as I suspected that their role wasn't what they claimed to be.***

***There was no way I was going to allow someone to deceive me. I analyzed the behavior of every liar, but never found any pattern. Because there were always honest players who behaved the same way. When I was sure that someone was lying, I would make sure they were killed, or kill them myself. And in that way my behavior only ruined the game. In such cases, I received a lot of anger and reports.***

***Eventually I was banned for 3 months. During that time, I didn't play at all, and I started to reevaluate my life. I realized that I can't be perfect, that there is no certain pattern to player behavior, and that it is impossible to know the outcome of a game. There will always be an event or possible exception that you've discarded in your calculations. And there's no way to know who's really lying.***

***As I played after my ban, I struggled with my desire to get back to my old self and investigate deceivers. At first it was very hard, my hands hurt from not being able to interrogate the players I suspected. At times like that I would just put my phone away, close my eyes and think about what I was doing all this for. And after a certain number of games, my addiction went down. After that point, with each game, I became calmer and calmer. My dark side faded away. And most surprisingly, I started to enjoy the game.***

***So I played a thousand games. And eventually, I changed beyond recognition. There was nothing left of the old me.***

***And in one of my games, I become friend of a girl who I liked for her skin and personality. In real life I was not social at all and had almost no friends. But here and now I had a chance to find a new friend, with whom we two would love to play and socialize.***

***Absolutely everything was going perfectly. I was getting really happy. We were having a great time communicating and playing with each other. She was the only one who put a smile on my face.***

***Do you think this is a story about my rehabilitation and friendship with a happy ending? I wish it was. But the past never leaves us.***

***I'm Vitaly, the smartest solo killer in Wolvesville. And this is the story of my last game.***
