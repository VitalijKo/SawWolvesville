### DAY 5

No one had any idea who would die that night, because the number of bad roles remained a secret to everyone. If the werewolves had successfully turned one of the villagers last night, there was only one werewolf left. The problem was that it could have been anyone, and there was no way of knowing who it was. Nor was there any way to know the role of the killer, who had not made himself known so far.

**Until the villagers heard the flick of a lighter.**

One by one, they began to burn.

***The arsonist set 2 zip_ (Doctor) on fire!***

***The arsonist set 3 CHILL1470 (Cupid) on fire!***

***The arsonist set 6 Jelloo (Vigilante) on fire!***

***The arsonist set 7 KeyDoor (Medium) on fire!***

***The arsonist set 14 Mylk (Witch) on fire!***

Only three left alive: Vitaly, his friend, and the detective.

**12 kill3r:** Hello, *Eslem*. Are you here?

**12 kill3r:** ARE YOU HERE??? OR SHOULD I CALL YOU BY YOUR NUMBER, 16???

**16 kqte:** I'm here...

**12 kill3r:** Did you really think I wouldn't realize anything? That I wouldn't notice anything? That I wouldn't remember anything?

**12 kill3r:** You don't know how attentive I've become since what happened to me. I've always been smart. And it was ridiculous of you to think I'd be tricked.

**12 kill3r:** The way they said hello to you before the game started. The way their skins and behavior seemed familiar to me. The way you behaved during the whole goddamn game.

**12 kill3r:** It couldn't have been a coincidence.

**12 kill3r:** I figured out who they were. I recognized them all. Even the 10 with the *enji* name. He's a former *disappointed*, isn't he? And that pathetic Dr. *zip_* is *check_me*. And Cupid the Loser *CHILL1470* hasn't bothered to change his idiotic nickname. He's in the same useless clan as them... As you, *5w6*.

There was dead silence. There seemed to be no one else in the universe but them. Vitaly felt a lump in his throat. The girl felt the same.

**16 kqte:** Vitaly... When I first met you, I really liked you. This is my second account. I played on it because my main account was banned for random kill.

**16 kqte:** After a whole day of playing with you, I was so happy that I texted my friends, disappointed and check_me, about you. We talked about you a bit, and they noticed a similarity between you and one player they saw a long time ago.

**16 kqte:** That's when they told me an incredible story about Vitaly and his games.

**16 kqte:** I didn't believe, I didn't *want* to believe that you were what they said you were. So they came up with a plan to find out if you are or not.

**16 kqte:** You only knew dissapointed and check_me, so they changed their names. I remembered when you were supposed to be back from university. At the right time, they created a game with friends and invited my main account, which I logged into from my computer. They also invited Pandacake and petit_donuts, who they were friends with. They all wanted to look at you. To them, you were... a legend. And to me, just a friend that I *loved* to play with.

**16 kqte:** On my phone, I logged into my second account and waited for you to text me. I knew you would.

**16 kqte:** When you sent me an invitation to the game, I accepted it.... But I didn't tell anyone about it because I didn't care at all about their prejudices, and I didn't want to go ahead with our plan.

**16 kqte:** Unfortunately, I forgot that I had a room with them open on my computer. They texted me and I didn't respond, so they suspected me of abandoning the plan.

**16 kqte:** check_me started going into the lobbies and watching the players. Finding me, told the others to start the game and they got right into that lobby. That was the reason they all greeted me.

**16 kqte:** The game started and I had no choice but to test you. I went offline on my phone so you'd think I couldn't see you and acted as usual.

**16 kqte:** But in the end, you became him. The god of the game. Controlling everything and knowing the outcome of every possible event.

**16 kqte:** You can be a person who is pleasant to play with. But once you get the role of a killer, your brain switches to "invincible genius" mode, your real self from the past manifests, from which you can't escape.

**12 kill3r:** But I've changed! I was never obsessed with winning for a solo killer! And I never analyzed anything, I just used my remaining good memory and logic!

**16 kqte:** And before, your emotionality always seemed fun to me. After the ban, you've trained your calmness and self-control. But today, when I didn't see anything, you stepped out the limits.

**12 kill3r:** What limits did I step out today? I was playing as a solo killer, so my insane tactic shouldn't bother anyone! And what about the insults, the whole chat was full of insults today!

**16 kqte:** That's right, no one can report you for your behavior today. But it's not about whether you broke any rules. It's that no matter how hard you try, you can't hide who you really are.

**12 kill3r:** For me, this game is more than just a game. I've always immersed myself in it as much as possible. I didn't like players who don't feel interested in the game.

**16 kqte:** Just because someone isn't like you, doesn't mean they don't have interest from the game. I agree with the first sentence of that message. But it's not interest, it's obsession.

**12 kill3r:** I *liked* you.

**16 kqte:** So did I.

The girl's last message was followed by the gong.

**4 Pandacake:** 12, all this time you've been the arsonist?

**12 kill3r:** Yes, I'm in fact the arsonist. But the villagers have already lost because the kitten-werewolf turned 16. So it's up to you to decide who wins.

**16 kqte:** No, I'm not turned!

**12 kill3r:** That's impossible. There's no one left to turn except the detective. But no one will turn the detective when half the players are alive.

**16 kqte:** I don't know why, but no one has been turned!

**12 kill3r:** You don't stand a chance. We all realize it happened and you can't prove otherwise.

**4 Pandacake:** Yeah, I'm actually left with a werewolf and the arsonist.

**12 kill3r:** 4, my sweet pancake, please give me this win. You know how hard it is to win for a killer.

**4 Pandacake:** Normally I would. But after all this, definitely not. I'm sorry.

Having said that, the girl voted him.

**16 kqte:** You know, Vitaly, I *forgive* you... 

*10...* 

**4 Pandacake:** WHAT???

**12 kill3r:** Forgive me?

*9...*

**16 kqte:** Yes, I forgive you. I like you too much to leave you.

*8...*

**12 kill3r:** I thought you didn't want to see me anymore!

*7...*

**16 kqte:** Of course I was angry. But I realized I can't be without you.

*6...*

**4 Pandacake:** Seriously??? ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND???

**12 kill3r:** Neither can I without you! Thank you!

*5...*

**16 kqte:** Goodbye, Pandacake.

After writing her parting words, she voted the detective.

*4...*

**4 Pandacake:** YOU CAN'T DO IT TO ME!!!

*3...*

**16 kqte:** Let me just tell you one thing, 12.

*2...*

**12 kill3r:** Like what?

*1...*

**16 kqte:** *No one* was turned into a werewolf that night.

**16 kqte:** GAME OVER.

**16 kqte won. They are the Headhunter!**
