### DAY 1

On the first night, the werewolves killed player number 6, who was the vigilante.

**4 Pandacake:** 1 ≠ 10.

**8 petit_donuts:** I'm the sheriff. No information for today.

**9 LadyFoxyS2:** I claim RRV.

**1 5w6:** I'm the flower child, I say it on the first day so the guardian wolf doesn't pretend to be one.

**12 kill3r:** Not a bad tactic, but silly, 1.

**1 5w6:** Do you know any better? Please share.

**12 kill3r:** Figure it out. That's what you need a brain for. I have enough to do in the game besides you.

**12 kill3r:** So, what conclusion can I draw? The random killer didn't kill anyone last night, so it's an illusionist.

**11 9909:** How do you know? It could be a sect leader.

**12 kill3r:** You're wrong. There is an illusionist in the game. If there was a sect leader, in all odds he would have been killed, if you consider the role distribution in recent games. Furthermore, it looks like you're the one who is.

**11 9909:** You're not making any sense. If you're the headhunter, just say so. We'll all kill you right away. Vigilante, reveal his role.

**12 kill3r:** I'd like it to happen the way you said, but the vigilante is dead. And there isn't even a jailer in the game to interrogate me and in extreme case kill me. So we're going to do things differently.

At this point the detective intervened in the fight.

**4 Pandacake:** Sorry to interrupt, but I think you've forgotten a bit of my information. Let me repeat it: 1 ≠ 10.

**4 Pandacake:** 1 or 10, have one of you name your role.

**1 5w6:** I told you! I'm the flower child!

**10 enfi:** Whatever. I'm sorry, but that's my role.

**10 enfi:** If the witch is in the game, please don't prolong agony 1. Kill her.

**1 5w6:** Me? Are you saying I'm lying when yorself spent half the discussion thinking of what to say?

**10 enfi:** I have no idea what you were claiming! No one even saw your claim! Because you're as quiet as you are dumb!

**11 9909:** No, no. I don't think she's dumber than 12.

**12 kill3r:** You lack a deep enough mind to hold more than one chain of logic in your head.

**1 5w6:** The guardian wolf is in the game. But even if the villagers kill me, they will see that I'm a true flower child, and one way or another they will kill you one day, even though it will take three of them. But the detective can speed up the process if she checks you out with someone good, and then that time is down to two days. And if you get killed by the witch, down to one.

**10 enfi:** You're a pretty good mathematician. 3 minus 1 is really 2. And minus 1 again is 1. But the only thing you got wrong is that it's all going to happen to you.  

The gong signal announced the start of voting. Vitaly immediately voted 11, and 11 voted him. Likewise 1 and 10 voted each other.

**11 9909:** How'd you get two votes?

**12 kill3r:** Thanks for the bread, baker! It's delicious! And I can give 2 whole votes to useless 11!

**11 9909:** You know what? I'm pretty sure you're a regular headhunter and can't do anything but accuse me. What about my role, it's capable of kill.

**12 kill3r:** But you're not the witch. Then you're the judge.

**11 9909:** WHAT THE HELL???

**11 9909:** AND YET, YOU'VE HAD IT. YOU'RE THE ONE I'M GONNA CHOOSE AS MY TARGET!!!

**12 kill3r:** Have a nice suicide.

**11 9909:** DON'T BLUFF ME HERE!!! I'M SURE YOU'RE THE FREAKING WOLF SEER!!! YOU KNOW MY ROLE AND YOU ONLY PRETEND TO BE THE HEADHUNTER!!!

**12 kill3r:** I'll only be happy if you die. Bye, bye.

**10 enji:** My God, will you stop your slaughter? Pay a fraction of your attention to the fact that 1 isn't the real flower child!

**8 petit_donuts:** I don't understand what's going on at all, or who to vote.

**10 enji:** FOR FREAKING 1!!!

**11 9909:** FOR FREAKING 12!!!

**1 5w6:** FOR FREAKING 10!!!

**12 kill3r:** FOR FREAKING 1!!!

Unable to stand it, one of the players sent the following message.

**3 NNNine:** What are you idiots doing? Please report 1 and 10 for gamethrowing.

After that, he ran away from the village. But not five seconds later, he was replaced by a hero with the name *CHILL1470*.

**CHILL1470:** Hello everyone! There are so many messages... What happened?

**11 9909:** 12, YOU SHOULDN'T BE SO OVERCONFIDENT. IF IT'S NOT ME, THEN THE WITCH OR VIGILANTE, IF HE IS REVIVED, WILL KILL YOU!!! BUT IT'S ALREADY CLEAR YOU'RE NOT A VILLAGER!!!

**10 enji:** SHUT YOUR FILTHY MOUTHS AND KILL PATHETIC 1!!! WHOSE BRAIN DOESN'T SUPPORT SUCH A FUNCTION AS LYING!!! GO AND READ SOME PSYCHOLOGY BOOKS, MAYBE THEY WILL SHED SOME LIGHT FOR YOU!!!

The votes were bouncing all four players. The villagers couldn't decide who to kill.

Despite the chaos, the detective pulled herself together and commanded.

**4 Pandacake:** 11 AND 12, HAVE YOUR SEXTING IN PRIVATE CHAT AS MUCH AS YOU WANT!!! 11, IF YOU'RE REALLY THE JUDGE, SENTENCE 1 OR 10!!! THEY ARE THE ONLY ONES WHO CAN BE EVIL!!!

**11 9909:** ALRIGHT, I'LL DO IT!!!

**11 9909:** BUT, 12, YOU'RE NOT GETTING OUT OF THIS GAME ALIVE!!!

Time's up. No one was lynched. The judge sentenced 1. But unfairly. And was executed by the villagers.
