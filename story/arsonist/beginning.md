## BEGINNING

After studying at the university, Vitaly was exhausted, his brain could not accommodate more information. When he returned home, he packed his things, sat down at his computer, put on his headphones and turned on his favorite music. Next, he picked up the phone and opened his favorite game, Wolvesville. He checked the friends list and saw that his new friend was online and playing right now.

**kqte.**

He entered the game as a spectator and explored the current situation. Kqte was alive. Her number was 7. Vitaly looked at the roles list and noticed that there was a live medium in the game. As night fell, he turned to him.

**kill3r:** Hi, Medium. Are you here?

**Medium:** Hi, yes.

**kill3r:** Can you please say hi to 7 for me?

**Medium:** I'm sorry, but I don't want to reveal myself.

**kill3r:** Damn... All right.

Vitaly was a little offended at the denial of his request, but knew it was the right thing to do, because if medium revealed his role for the sake of it, the werewolves would want to kill him. Besides, he hadn't revived anyone yet, which increased his value.

On the sixth game day, the game ended.

**kill3r:** Hi, 7!!!!!!

**7 kqte:** Hi!!!!!!

**kill3r:** Can I invite you?

**7 kqte:** Yes, of course.

Pleased with her agreement, he navigated to the home screen, clicked on *"Play"* and in the menu clicked on *"Play with friends"*. When the room loaded, he invited the girl.

**kqte joined.**

**kill3r:** Hi!

**kqte:** Hi!

**kill3r:** How are you?

**kqte:** I'm okay. And you?

**kill3r:** Not so great. Was. Until 20:10.

**kqte:** What happened at 20:10?

**kill3r:** Look at the time.

**kqte:** Oh, that's what you mean!!! It's really good to see you too!!!

**kill3r:** I know. But seriously, everything is actually fine. Today was the math analysis exam, and by all appearances I passed it. First you had to name the formulation of the theorem, then calculate the derivative of a function. I did everything correctly. That was good enough for a grade of 3. After that there were the main tasks, some of which I think I did correctly.

**kqte:** Well, that's great! Congratulations to you!

**...**

They talked about various topics for a while, including the events that had happened in their lives. Yes, it had only been one day since the last time they had seen each other, but did it really matter? And It wasn't exactly "for a while" either. About half an hour. But then what? They enjoyed chatting, and that was all that mattered.

At the end, they wrote about their daily tasks and wished each other luck in completing them. That was the end of the dialog.

**kill3r:** So, I'm going to start the game. Are you ready?

**kqte:** Yes!

At this point the game could have started, but it didn't. Vitaly never started it. There was silence for about a minute, and finally the girl asked a leading question.

**kqte:** So?

**kill3r:** ?

**kqte:** Maybe it was imaginary to me, but you wanted to start the game...

**kill3r:** Yeah! I'm starting!

But the game didn't start.

After that, the girl sent a crying emoji.

**kill3r:** Well, I'm starting the timer for 30 seconds!

**kqte:** ...

**kill3r:** 20.

**kqte:** 50.

**kill3r:** 10.

**kqte:** 0.

**kill3r:** 5.

**kqte:** 100.

**kill3r:** 4 3 2 1.

**kqte:** 123.

**kill3r:** The game has begun!

The room they had gotten into was almost full. Due to the different speeds of the networks they were connected to, they weren't standing next to each other. Vitaly got number 12, Kqte â€” 16.

**12 kill3r:** I actually purposely waited a while for one of the games running in parallel to end, and most of the players clicked on *"Play Again*", therefore filling up the room.

**16 kqte:** How clever you are.

Looking around at those in attendance, Vitaly felt as if a few names he had seen once before. He looked at their outfits, and they seemed just as familiar. To quench his curiosity, he also looked at the profiles of each of them, but no pictures from the past were given to him by his memory. Until the game started, he tried to remember who they might have been, when he might have seen them, what dialogs or fights they might have had between them, but nothing came to his mind.

Suddenly they all sent messages addressed to his friend.

**10 enji:** Hi 16!

**2 zip_:** Hiiiiiiii 16!

She greeted in reply.

**16 kqte:** Oh, you're all here! Hi!!!

Vitaly was surprised at what had happened and asked her a question about it.

**12 kill3r:** Do you know them?

But even if she was about to write something, she wouldn't have time.

The timer counted down from five to one. The wheels on the screens spinned. The friends were given their roles. The game has begun.
