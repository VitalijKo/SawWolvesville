### DAY 3

Night fell, and halfway through, the witch used the death potion on 13, the wolf seer. The werewolves killed 8, but the revelation of her role came as a surprise to all.

She turned out to be the medium.

**4 Pandacake:** 8 ≠ 15.

**4 Pandacake:** OMG...

**1 5w6:** I had no idea she was medium...

**10 enji:** What the hell is this? 9's death was scribed, and he was actually the sheriff. On the second night 8 got information from him and told everyone. She decided to impersonate the sheriff. But why?

**4 Pandacake:** I don't understand the meaning of it myself. Maybe she wanted to protect the sheriff so she could die in his place. But it's a bad tactic, it won't make anyone better, because the medium is no less valuable than the sheriff.

**10 enji:** I agree. It's the first time I've seen such an unusual tactic from a villager. Maybe she wanted to experiment.

**1 5w6:** I want to make an important note. She claimed sheriff back on day one. And no one counter claimed her.

**10 enji:** So they agreed to play it that way? That's reportable.

**4 Pandacake:** Yes. At the end of the game, we report 8 and 9.

Suddenly, player 7 joined the conversation.

**7 KeyDoor:** Hi, everybody. Sorry, I was a little confused. Thought maybe I had some kind of bug. Anyway... The thing is, I'm the medium.

**12 kill3r:** How?

**7 KeyDoor:** I don't know. I guess 8's death was scribed.

**12 kill3r:** Vigilante, if 7 is the fake medium, shoot him.

**7 KeyDoor:** I told him the number. That's me.

**6 Jello:** I'm sorry, but I don't remember who the medium is... I'm the vigilante. The medium told me his number, but I can't remember if it was 7 or 8.

**12 kill3r:** ...

**7 KeyDoor:** Are you serious?

**6 Jelloo:** I'm sorry.

**4 Pandacake:** Then there's no choice but to lynch him.

**7 KeyDoor:** No, no... This is such a joke, isn't it?

**1 5w6:** But if he's actually the medium, he could be the target of the headhunter.

**12 kill3r:** The odds of that are too low.

**1 5w6:** After playing with you, 12, I realized that you shouldn't ignore even the smallest of probabilities...

**12 kill3r:** Yes, but not when you're playing with someone who can calculate them.

**1 5w6:** Don't overestimate your abilities.

**12 kill3r:** Don't underestimate my abilities. You don't understand the current situation in the game at all.

**4 Pandacake:** And what if the vigilante is coupled with a werewolf, so he wants to frame the medium?

**12 kill3r:** This isn't the case. 10 is coupled with 1.

**1 5w6:** ...What?

**12 kill3r:** 1 is the flower child and can protect her lover, which will prolong his execution. 7 we can lynch anyway.

**1 5w6:** HOW DO YOU KNOW??? ARE YOU CUPID??? ARE YOU BETRAYING US???

**3 CHILL_1470:** Absolutely not. Cupid is me.

**12 kill3r:** Of course. I know you're cupid.

**12 kill3r:** And, 1, what you said about his betrayal shows that I'm right.

**1 5w6:** HOW ELSE DID YOU KNOW THAT???

**12 kill3r:** 10, that's really funny what you set up. You purposely started the argument with 1 to create doubt among the villagers and hide the fact that you're coupled.

**12 kill3r:** It was so plausible that the past cupid number 3 fled the village. He must have had a heart attack, which is apparent from the way he asked in desperation before what you were doing. 

**1 5w6:** NONSENSE!!! YOU CAN'T TELL ANYTHING FROM THIS!!! YOU'RE A HACKER!!! YOU HACKED THE ROLES AND PRETEND YOU FIGURED IT OUT!!! EVERYONE, REPORT HIM!!!

**12 kill3r:** Hacker? Don't flatter me, 1.

**12 kill3r:** 6, finish her so she can get her talker down.

**6 Jelloo:** Okay. Bye, 1.

**10 enji:** NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!

**12 kill3r:** Game over.

Vigilante shot 1, flower child. The wolf scribe lost the love of his life and fled the village.

**4 Pandacake:** Good shot.

**4 Pandacake:** 12, although you're a little out of your mind, you're pretty smart.

**3 CHILL1470:** My couple...

**12 kill3r:** I'm sorry, 3. That's the pair you chose. We couldn't help it.

**12 kill3r:** 4, you like playing with me?

**4 Pandacake:** WHAT??? NO!!! I'M GOING ON VACATION RIGHT AFTER THIS GAME. TO FIX MY MORALE BENT BY YOU!!!

**12 kill3r:** Don't be shy, *pancake*. You can add friend me and play with a professional.

**4 Pandacake:** NO WAY!!! 

**12 kill3r:** Whatever. I'm only offering once.

**16 kqte:** Yeah, 12. As soon as I left, you found yourself a new friend.

**12 kill3r:** 16!!! YOU'RE HERE!!!

**12 kill3r:** No, of course not. I don't need a half-baked Sherlock like that.

**12 kill3r:** Her IQ level matches the quality of the dough she's made of. For a pancake, it's terrible.

**16 kqte:** Okay, I got you...

With those words, the girl once again went offline.

**4 Pandacake:** ...

**4 Pandacake:** I really want to hope your role is bad, because I have a huge desire to finish you.

**4 Pandacake:** But given what you wrote, it sounds like you're the doctor.

**12 kill3r:** I'm sorry for that. Well, you can finish me next time.

**2 zip_:** Wait. I'm the doctor, aren't I?

**12 kill3r:** Did you just swim out of your hole, you damn pike? Swim back and keep your mouth shut if you don't want to die.

Once Vitaly said that, the voting stage began.

**12 kill3r:** So, who are we lynching? If I'm not mistaken, 4 checked 8 with someone who turned out not to be equal to her. I just can't remember who.

**12 kill3r:** 4, remind us, please?

**4 Pandacake:** I've already forgotten myself... I'll look it up.

**4 Pandacake:** I checked her with 15. 8 ≠ 15.

**12 kill3r:** Well, 15, you lost. I suggest you confess to your crimes.

**15 xJIGSAWx:** Don't you want to confess to yours? 

**12 kill3r:** I wish I could, but I have nothing to confess.

**15 xJIGSAWx:** You act like you know and control everything. Like the outcome of this game is completely within your control. But it's not. We know more than you expect, and you know less than you think you do.

**12 kill3r:** You sound right in line with your name. Like Saw. But you're not him. And before you die, just for you, I'm gonna say his quote.

**12 kill3r:** Game over.

Vitaly proclaimed this phrase, and the player's execution followed. His role was revealed and everyone saw that he was the kitten-werewolf.

Which meant that at night someone would be turned into a werewolf.
