**VitalijKo: Hi everyone... My name is Vitaly. I won't be here for long. Just wanted to give you some information that, if you use it correctly, will help you win. But it's up to you to decide whether you listen to it or not.**

**VitalijKo:** One player is about to die. I've encrypted his number, day and cause of death. If you solve the code, you have a chance to save him. If you fail to do so, he will inevitably die. But worse, you'll get a new code, with a new victim.

**VitalijKo:** I see you all want to lynch me and to kill with your powers. I can understand that, and I'd do the same if I were you. Except my death won't change anything. But if I live, you will have a key to the solution. I wish you good luck, and I'm happy to announce that...
