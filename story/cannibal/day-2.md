### DAY 2

The medium revived 2, but died himself. Well, herself. Because she was WolfAshley.

**13 VitalijKo:** Look how brainless 15 is. She revived a jailer instead of an aura seer for the sole reason that he insulted her friend. Rest in peace, 5. This village doesn't deserve you. May 15 burn in hell.

**16 Pantasy:** She did the right thing. Jailer is more useful than aura seer. And you were a cannibal, and you're still a cannibal. That's my information for tonight. I checked 11 last night. She's fool.

**13 VitalijKo:** Well, no. Look at her. Look at that slut. I can just feel 5 spinning in his coffin. Keeps blaming me when I saved the village from her own mistake.

**11 Kami01:** And why am I a fool? What did I ever do to you?

**16 Pantasy:** Like I don't know you're friends. 15 saw you with him, and also with 10.

**13 VitalijKo:** So what, you admitted to giving false information because you don't like us?

**16 Pantasy:** What? WHAT??? NO!!! OF COURSE NOT!!! I DIDN'T MEAN THAT AT ALL!!!

**13 VitalijKo:** You can make your pathetic excuses as much as you want. But I don't think anyone is interested in them. We all reported you a long time ago, and soon you will get your ban.

**11 Kami01:** You're going on vacation, bitch.

**16 Pantasy:** Well, if you're so sure of my deception, will you tell us your *real* roles? So everyone can see how evil I am.

**11 Kami01:** Sorry, villagers, I have no choice. I'm doctor.

**13 VitalijKo:** And my role, while not cannibal, is evil. I'm *wolf seer*.

**16 Pantasy:** What?

**10 Ryuushi:** What?

**11 Kami01:** What? 

The girls were clearly shocked by such a confession.

**13 VitalijKo:** Honestly, I don't care about this game at all. It's ruined by 16, and my goal is to get rid of her. Then I'll go to another game and play alone with my favorite 10 and 11.

**16 Pantasy:** What the hell is going on here? Okay, whatever. 10, then shoot your "favorite" 13.

**10 Ryuushi:** No way. He's been a great help to us. I'm sure he'll get a good beating from the werewolf team. No doubt they've all reported him. So no one's hurting him.

**16 Pantasy:** 2, can't you at least have some sense?

**2 Suzuha:** I support her. 13 will live.

**16 Pantasy:** Then you'll get a report for dereliction of duty.

**13 VitalijKo:** And who's going to report them? 

**16 Pantasy:** The fact that I'll do is enough.

**13 VitalijKo:** Not so. Experience shows that those who have been complained about by a lot of players recently are promptly banned. But if it's 1-2, nothing will happen to you.

**16 Pantasy:** And what are you dumb idiots going to do without info roles?

**13 VitalijKo:** *I'll turn in all the werewolves*.

**...**

Everyone was, to say the least, shocked by this statement.

**16 Pantasy:** Are you... Are you out of your mind?

**13 VitalijKo:** I have nothing left to lose. Like you, I'll be banned. And I'm finally switching to the villagers team to save them from you.

**10 Ryuushi:** Vitaly! Don't!

**13 VitalijKo:** I love you, my sweet 10, but this is the way it has to be.

**16 Pantasy:** Why are you sad? He has dozens of accounts in this game. Play on another one, and there's nothing to be afraid of being banned.

**13 VitalijKo:** I only have three accounts. And the third one is not the main one, but only for gold mining. I don't play on it anymore since I reached level 30.

**16 Pantasy:** And who's after me if not you?

**13 VitalijKo:** I've told you everything. And time's almost up, so I'm gonna say one more thing. 1 is the first werewolf. We lynch her. 14 is the second, I'll ask 10 to shoot him.

**1 cloudsnine:** Me?

**13 VitalijKo:** Yes, you.

The dialog was interesting, but was interrupted by a bullet hitting 14 directly in the head. The beast bunter.

**16 Pantasy:** Really?

**10 Ryuushi:** Vitaly... How come?

**2 Suzuha:** Deceiver!

The players had become frustrated with 13, but his next message showed his own dissatisfaction.

**13 VitalijKo:** DAMN!!!

In the confusion, they completely forgot to remove the votes from 1, and her death could have followed. If she wasn't protected from execution.
