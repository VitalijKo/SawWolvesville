### DAY 3

**16 Pantasy:** I know no one will consider my information, but 4 is wolf shaman.

**13 VitalijKo:** PLEASE FORGIVE ME!!! MY TYPO!!! IT'S 4, NOT 14!!! 4!!! I ACCIDENTALLY WROTE ONE!!! YOU KNOW, I WAS SHORT ON TIME, IN A HURRY, AND DIDN'T NOTICE THE MISTAKE!!! I REALLY DIDN'T MEAN FOR IT TO HAPPEN!!!

**16 Pantasy:** Coincidentally... No way.

**10 Ryuushi:** So he's not lying?

**2 Suzuha:** He didn't lie about 1. I guess it's actually a typo.

**16 Pantasy:** But then who saved 4 if he wasn't a flower child?

**8 hyhye__in:** I'm flower child, and I didn't save her. There's a guardian wolf in the game, and he's the one who did.

**13 VitalijKo:** Yes, of course. You can see that.

**4 CutieCat:** Wait a minute... But I'm doctor?

The audience looked at her and laughed out loud.

**4 CutieCat:** What's wrong?

**11 Kami01:** Nothing, nothing at all. Except if you're a doctor, why would a guardian wolf save you? Not to mention I said something about being a doctor just yesterday.

**4 CutieCat:** I didn't notice that. Right now I'm doing my homework, so I've been AFK most of the game. I put a protection on seer and walked away.

**11 Kami01:** So, which one of you believes her?

As expected, there was silence in response. But one player sent something mysterious.

**3 foxluver:** I believe the reason, but not the fact.

**11 Kami01:** I don't get it. Can you elaborate?

**3 foxluver:** The reason why she couldn't expose him gives me credence. I'm in exactly the same situation myself: repeating study materials for an upcoming test paper, and consequently not paying attention to the game. But I don't trust the *fact*, since the doctor is not her, but me.

**4 CutieCat:** ...

**11 Kami01:** Listen, you speak beautifully. Very poetic. And normally, everyone would love to hear your lies. They'd be mesmerized by it, and you'd convince them of it. But in this case, the lie sounded too utopian to even try to accept it.

**3 foxluver:** Mouth shut, dearie. Or have you been sucking cock so often that you've forgotten how to close it?

**11 Kami01:** WHAT??? HOW DARE YOU SAY THAT???

**3 foxluver:** Oh, yeah... I can feel how much you want to suck me off! My cock is big, I promise you'll love it!

**11 Kami01:** All right. Kill 3. And I don't care what you say.

**16 Pantasy:** Are you dumb? Don't you realize that's what he's trying to do? There's no doubt he's fool and you're falling for his tricks.

**11 Kami01:** Are you some kind of psychologist?

**16 Pantasy:** I've been playing this game for a huge amount of time and I'm well aware of how werewolves and soloers behave. But even that doesn't matter, because we so have a found werewolf number 4. Don't you think it's logical to kill him first?

**11 Kami01:** I think it's logical to avenge my insult!

**13 VitalijKo:** And I'll help you, 11!

**10 Ryuushi:** Certainly, me too! 

**2 Suzuha:** Absolutely in solidarity with 11!

**16 Pantasy:** You're really retarded, for that matter.

**11 Kami01:** 2 please be so kind as to execute 4 this night.

**4 CutieCat:** For starters, think about how you explain this! Why does the seer get to see me as wolf shaman if I'm doctor! The only possible option is that 16 is fake seer and she's playing along with 13!

**13 VitalijKo:** Fake as fake can be. And we've known that for a long time.

The voting began, during which the residents chose 3, and the jailer prepared to arrest 4.

That's when it hit the girl.

**4 CutieCat:** But wait... No... There's another option...

**16 Pantasy:** What are you talking about?

**4 CutieCat:** He planned the whole thing...

**16 Pantasy:** Who? And what exactly is that?

**4 CutieCat:** From the beginning, 13 knew he could pull off a double kill with me in the lead. He said 14 was a werewolf and pretended to make a typo the next day. The wolf shaman was smart. He got the thought of a possible strategy for 13 into his head and enchanted 4 in case he was right. And so it turned out to be. By incredible coincidence, 16 also targeted 4. And I became evil to everyone, with no chance for a retraction of my guilt.

**16 Pantasy:** Omg... Have you been watching too many detective movies? Who's gonna believe you? This isn't a movie where the villain can think about your every move! And where events have a one-millionth chance of happening!

**4 CutieCat:** But you're in exactly the same situation! You're seer! And you know the roles of 11 and 13, but no one believes you! And you have talked yourself  about who 13 is! A man with a genius memory and a raging desire for revenge! Yes, 16, it's not a movie, but it's not your game. It's *his* game.

**16 Pantasy:** Damn it, 4, no one wants us! This place is all about him! There's nothing we can do about it! It's easier to kill you to end it all! Let's just end it!

**4 CutieCat:** CANNIBAL WILL WIN!!! 13 WILL WIN!!! YOU CAN'T LET HIM WIN!!!

**13 VitalijKo:** 16 has already accepted her fate, girl. Accept it too.

**4 CutieCat:** YOU CAN'T GET AWAY WITH THIS!!!

**13 VitalijKo:** Oh, no, I can. I've been waiting for this moment for months. And I'm going to savor it to the fullest.

**4 CutieCat:** GIVE ME ONE LAST ANSWER, WHO IS 5???

**13 VitalijKo:** Cursed.

**4 CutieCat:** DIE, BASTARD!!!

**13 VitalijKo:** Game over.

And the "fox lover" has gone to the other side. What was the name of his role? Of course...

*Cursed.*
