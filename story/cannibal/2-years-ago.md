## 2 YEARS AGO. CLAIRE

<br>

My world has been turned upside down. I constantly feel like he's watching me. I see him in random players, and I paranoidly go to their profiles to check who they really are. Of course, it's useless, because he could be anyone, anywhere. He sees every game I play, and I'll never know where exactly he's hiding.

I'm haunted by the number 11. The number of the day he was born. It's always a key number in my games. It's the number that ruins the game and my team loses, or causes an impossible game-changing twist. There are all kinds of situations. And there's only one player in charge â€“ number 11.

Maybe I shouldn't have done that to him. Ignoring him and then blocking him. But his jealousy... Whenever I played with someone else, he killed them in the most sophisticated way possible. Notice: not only when we played with him too. Even if I played without him, alone with my friends, he would appear out of nowhere, taunt them, and kill.

When it first started happening, it seemed like a simple coincidence to me. It was just some crazy people targeting my friends for some reason and brutalizing them. Especially since I didn't recognize their nicknames or profiles in general. But as time went on, it came to my attention that he might be responsible for this. He was obsessed with this game. He had three main accounts. And how many fake accounts he had, I can't imagine. On each of them, he regularly spun the gold wheel and grinded in boost games. All had such different designs that it was impossible to find him among them.

My friends gave him the nickname Cannibal. He sneaks up stealthily and attacks unexpectedly, leaving no chance for an unprepared victim to escape. And then he eats them, savoring the flavor.

*That's an interesting nickname you've given me. Cannibal. Let's pretend it's true. The first snow has fallen, and I'm in disguise. Only my red eyes give me away as I watch your every move. I see my target, which means it's time to play my game.*
