### DAY 4

As the moon rose, a shot rang out. Caused by the fact that 2 had executed her prisoner. To everyone's surprise, the unfortunate 4 was doctor. The werewolves, in turn, sent her to the same place, to the dead. No one doubted: they would have an extremely interesting and friendly dialog in the chat.

But in the immediate next moment, they froze with shock.

***The hungry cannibal has eaten 1 cloudsnine.***

***The  hungry cannibal ate 7 xmonxca (Wolf seer).***

***The  hungry cannibal ate 8 hyhye__in (Flower child).***

***The  hungry cannibal ate 9 AlienL (Wolf shaman).***

Vitaly twisted his neck in different directions so that it crunched.

**13 VitalijKo:** Ohhh... That was delicious!

**16 Pantasy:** See, blockheads? What did I tell you? 13 is cannibal and 11 is fool.

**13 VitalijKo:** Such truth... Hmm.... Not good for anything. You need challenge, brain food. But Kamilla and I just wanted to win. That was our plan, our strategy. To make it look like a former friend wanted to get back at us. We were all in the movie, just like 4 said! We're in the movie! Really in the movie! And all you had to do was to watch. As the investigation unfolded. As the good guys try to defeat the bad guys.

**13 VitalijKo:** "The evil seer betrayed the village." That's what people are interested in. Not the nonsense, albeit real, that you've been trying to get across to everyone. You haven't tried much, though. You've accepted your fate, and that's the right thing to do. If you're terminally ill, it's easier to commit suicide. There's no reason to suffer for long. Any reasonable person would do the same.

**13 VitalijKo:** And I would have killed you, but let to live, because you're exactly what we came for. A lot of people don't appreciate the friends they have. But not you and not anymore.

**13 VitalijKo:** So I'm closing this door, keeping you here forever.

**16 Pantasy:** Are you an idiot? Did you forget we're in a game, not a bathroom? What the hell is a door?

**13 VitalijKo:** Consider it morally this way. Morally, I'm locking you in the bathroom because you failed your test.

**16 Pantasy:** Vitaly. Everyone is dead now. Me and the others have gotten reports and will be banned soon. You won. So why continue your show? Admit that there was no test.

**16 Pantasy:** You were jealous of my friends, even including female ones. Created multiple accounts to spy on me and ruin my games. To mock us and set up by making us die and getting reports from other players. You thought I wouldn't recognize you, but that was impossible. After all, you told me about yourself, about loving this game and spending a lot of effort on it. No one else could have done the same to me. You were obsessed with it. And I don't know what you wanted from me other than to break up. But even when I did, you didn't let up. Just like today, you were playing with your new friends, and when you saw me, continued your torment. Enough games. Tell me, what do you want from me?

Vitaly waited a few seconds, processing what he had heard.

**13 VitalijKo:** What are you talking about? I'm serious! I only have three accounts, and I've never created more. You abandoned me without saying anything. Of course I was mad at you, but got over it quickly. As you can see, made new friends. I forgot about you. Just today when I met you, I decided to get revenge. But I've never done anything like this before. So tell me, why did you really leave me?

As the gong signaled the start of the voting, Vitaly and Claire pointed at each other.

**10 Ryuushi:** I trusted you, Vitaly! And you deceived me so easily! You miserable traitor!

Furious, his friend voted for him.

**13 VitalijKo:** Go to hell. 11, vote for her. Let's kill the lying bitch.

And Kamilla voted.

*Him.*

## 3 YEARS AGO. KAMILLA

My name is Kamilla. I'm 15 years old. I'm three months younger than my new friend, Vitaly, who is now 16. We met in Wolvesville. In one game, he got attached to me and acted like we were the main characters there. Like it's just me and him. Like we're the ones who decide the fate of the game. He *hypnotized* me. No one else in the game gave me that kind of importance. And I actually liked him. Everyone was mad at him, insulting, threatening with reports. But that wasn't what we cared so much about.

Over the course of the way we played, I liked him more and more. We told each other about ourselves and learned many new things. I enjoyed talking to him immensely. Then Instagram, Discord, and we continued communicating there. Vitaly was a very interesting person. He easily came up with a topic for conversation and talked so actively and emotionally that I didn't notice how a smile would appear on my face. Time flew by completely unnoticed. I felt like I was falling in love.

We were similar in our addiction to this game. I gave it a lot of resources, both material and time. It was a part of my life. Unlike me, though, Vitaly didn't love it. Almost never donates his money. From his attitude, I'd say he would *destroy* it at the first opportunity. But still, was obsessed.

He had multiple accounts so to mine gold on them and play simultaneously to win for solo killers. The main ones were three, but *not* the main ones at least five. To take control of the games whenever he wanted to win. He didn't specifically talk about them, but I've seen him use them with my own eyes. He once won this way for evil detective, a new role that came out recently, and sent me a video. I was grateful to him for such an idea for *my* case.

*If you don't be mine, you won't be anyone's.*

Of course, a man like Vitaly couldn't be friends with just me. Especially since I'm not the most interesting girl. He had several female friends with whom he played regularly. But no one knew that they were nothing to him. I was the only one who knew. I liked hiding that information and watching them. However, there was one particular girl. *Claire*. My biggest rival. He loved her more than the others. He invited her over all the time, which made it a threesome.

I had no choice. I didn't want to leave so he wouldn't fall out of love with me. I had to tolerate her presence and try to get more attention. Claire didn't understand any of that, she was too dumb to do so, and didn't share my goal. But I was very jealous and couldn't handle it. I wanted him to be mine. Only mine.

I couldn't take it much longer, and I was sick of it. So I decided to use his own methods to get rid of her once and for all. Frame him. Imitate his behavior. Switch places. To hunt her down on his behalf. As if it wasn't me, but him dying of jealousy.

No one would believe him for anything in the world.

*That's an interesting nickname you've given me. Cannibal. Let's pretend it's true. The first snow has fallen, and I'm in disguise. Only my red eyes give me away as I watch your every move. I see my target, which means it's time to play my game.*

Kamilla switched her vote to Claire at the very last second, causing a tie, and Vitaly was saved. In the night, he killed 10. And then they were down to three.
