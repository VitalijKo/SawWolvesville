### DAY 1

During the night, the werewolves killed player number 2. Seeing her role, everyone felt sadness. It was called jailer.

**12 SomeDarkness:** 13 is cannibal.

**13 VitalijKo:** What?

**12 SomeDarkness:** What, cannibal?

**13 VitalijKo:** Who are you talking to? 

**12 SomeDarkness:** Are you deaf?

**13 VitalijKo:** I don't understand who she's talking to. Does anyone understand?

**12 SomeDarkness:** You're the only one who can't understand.

**13 VitalijKo:** What do you think I don't understand?

**12 SomeDarkness:** That you're gonna die. And that's not my view, that's everybody's view.

**13 VitalijKo:** The true seer, please come forward! You won't let a slut decide my fate!

**16 Pantasy:** I'm sorry, Vitaly. But I'm aura seer. I checked 12. And she has a good aura. Which means she can't be lying.

**5 Berrylicious:** What? But I'm the aura seer?

**13 VitalijKo:** Claire?

**16 Pantasy:** Thanks for reminding me of my name.

**16 Pantasy:** Shut your mouth, 5. And learn to play the fool. 

**13 VitalijKo:** Why are you doing this to me?

**5 Berrylicious:** I don't lie! I'm the aura seer! And my information is as follows: 10 is unknown! And 16 is just pretending to be one!

**16 Pantasy:** I'm doing to you exactly what you did to me.

**13 VitalijKo:** You're the one who deleted me from friends for absolutely no reason!

**16 Pantasy:** Because I couldn't stand your stalking!

**16 Pantasy:** 5, then why didn't you tell me your information before, but only now? 

**13 VitalijKo:** What the hell kind of stalking?

**16 Pantasy:** Do you really think I'm that dumb? You think I don't find the constant deaths of my friends strange? And in the most brutal way possible?

**5 Berrylicious:** Because I hate the aura seer role, 16! I only find players with unknown aura all the time! And I'm so tired of it I didn't even want to write my info!

**13 VitalijKo:** I liked you, and I would never hurt you. No matter what excuse you gave me. And I didn't care about your friends.

**16 Pantasy:** 15, will you tell him?

**15 WolfAshley:** Yes, 13, I confirm what she said. I remember everything. Especially the game that happened about two weeks ago with me and 16.

**11 Kami01:** What game?

**15 WolfAshley:** He was corruptor then. Of course, I didn't recognize him, since I'd never seen that account before, and he hardly ever wrote anything in chat. But then it was just me and him, not counting the third, glitched, player. And until the end of the voting timer, he wrote me insulting messages, mocking my helplessness, and telling me I was unworthy of 16. I talked to him, tried to reason with him, explained how insane he was. But still he stood his ground. To my relief, time was up and I thought we'd be getting the hell out of this game soon. But what he did was beyond belief.

**11 Kami01:** What happened?

The other player just wouldn't quit.

**5 Berrylicious:** Someone! Help! 16 wants to take my role away from me!

**15 WolfAshley:** From the very beginning, as soon as the gong struck, he voted me. I expected to die at this point, and it would be over.... 

**11 Kami01:** But..?

**15 WolfAshley:** But at the last, very last second, he... Took his vote away. The last player died, and it was just the two of us. Then I thought he was gonna glitch me to torture me more. But it turned out he had something else in mind...

**11 Kami01:** He didn't glitch you?

**15 WolfAshley:** No, and the next day he continued to insult me. More violent. Every message in capital letters. I tried to argue with him again, but it was impossible to change his mind. Well, when that fact became clear in my mind, I stopped responding to him altogether. I didn't respond to every message he sent. However, he didn't stop. He wrote with such triumph, as if he had won a competition, and reveled in his own superiority.

**11 Kami01:** But after that, he killed you?

**15 WolfAshley:** He didn't vote for me this time. I assumed that in the heat of his anger, he'd forgotten. So I decided to vote for him myself at the very end.

**11 Kami01:** And it worked?

**15 WolfAshley:** Half a second after the timer showed "1", I pressed his number. My plan had worked, so it seemed to me. But suddenly the chat displayed a system message saying that the villagers hadn't decided who to lynch. Glancing at the player field, I saw his vote standing over me. He had read my mind and outplayed me.

**11 Kami01:** I'll ask you right away: how did the next day end?

**15 WolfAshley:** He started making fun of me. Said how "dumb" I was, and didn't understand why 16 chose me as her friend. And voted me. But I knew he wouldn't want to kill me, and I was sure he would eventually remove his vote. But given the way he read my mind last time, it was clear that he did now. So, at the last second, I did nothing. I didn't vote for him.

**11 Kami01:** Did he kill you?

**15 WolfAshley:** Nope. The villagers hadn't decided who to lynch. He managed to remove his vote.

**11 Kami01:** He's calculated it all out again...

**15 WolfAshley:** Exactly. He killed me the next day with a glitch. Like he always does, taunting me.

**13 VitalijKo:** Total insanity. Which I didn't do. This is the first I've heard of your idiotic story. 10, please shoot 12. So they can see she's not who she says she is.

**15 WolfAshley:** Why would she do that?

**13 VitalijKo:** Because she, unlike you, is a normal person. And a friend of mine.

The girl pulled the trigger, and everyone was convinced of the truth of Vitalij's words.

***10 Ryuushi (Gunner) has shot 12 SomeDarkness (Junior werewolf).***

***The death of the junior werewolf has been avenged, 5 Berrylicious (Aura seer) is dead!***

**13 VitalijKo:** Are you convinced? Dullards. Thank you, dear 10.

**10 Ryuushi:** You're welcome! I couldn't watch her lie and not blush!

**16 Pantasy:** What the hell is this? Team play is forbidden!

**13 VitalijKo:** Like giving false information as seer. And also misappropriating someone else's role. After all, you were the seer. But pretended to be the aura seer and confirmed a known nonvillager. Just to kill me.

**5 Berrylicious:** Totally agree! Dumb female!

**13 VitalijKo:** Now tell us your real information or we'll all report you.

With a few seconds left until the end of the vote, Claire knew what she was going to say.

**16 Pantasy:** I hate you!
