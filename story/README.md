# Introduction

**Saw: Wolvesville** is the story of one Wolvesville player. Vitaly, an introvert who is neglected in real life, and longs to become the God of the game in order to show everyone that he was underrated. To do this, he plays as solo killers and thinks through the game to the smallest detail, knowing the outcome of each of these games in advance. No one can change their fate. But things don't always go according to plan...

On his way, he meets a girl who seems to be just as smart as he is. And she is determined to stop him at all costs. But how do you do that when your opponent has already read everything a long time ago? A complex psychological game begins, in which only the most attentive can survive. Anyone who intervenes will die.

Vitaly has one weakness â€“ love, which constantly gets in his way. Its used by a group of friends who are never left out. Every game hides something that he could not have foreseen. And in the end, it opens, leaning on him with terrible force. He only gets more insane, and with each defeat, he is filled with the desire for revenge.

Wolvesville players, get ready. He is about to start his game. You will never forget it...
