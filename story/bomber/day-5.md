### DAY 5

**1 GLITCH:** Well, we won?

**2 Jumana:** We won.

**1 straykidz:** How come? There are 3 villagers and one bomber in the game. You can't break the rules, can you?

**2 Jumana:** No one canceled that. You must have been pretty dumb if you didn't realize that artificial intelligence analyzes everything in players. Same with us. It knew we were good friends. Knew all of our relationships. And knew I was the most likely to help him.

**2 Jumana:** Do you have the stream opened?

**2 Jumana:** 1, please show the command line. And display the current chain of events. Special to 11.

**1 GLITCH:** Sure.

After waiting for her instructions to be carried out, the girl continued.

**2 Jumana:** So, now do you understand? All of my actions were part of a plan. And it's perfectly clear that the next step is my vote for you.

**2 Jumana:** My account will probably be banned. But I don't care about that. Because now everyone knows the truth about Jalous and tanimaaaa.

**2 Jumana:** But tanimaaaa will never be with us anyway. After Vitaly and I hacked into her Discord account. Breaking all sorts of rules on the game server, we got her demoted and banned. And then it turned out that her game account credentials were the same as her Discord account. So we got her banned there as well.

**11 straykidz:** You're insane...

**2 Jumana:** Insanity is doing the same thing and hoping for a different result.

**11 straykidz:** And why did I spell and revive you specifically...

**2 Jumana:** The program showed that you like to target players similar to you. High level, lots of slots, and good outfits. By those parameters, I was the best fit.

**11 straykidz:** It's impossible for the program to figure that out...

**2 Jumana:** HOWEVER, YOU DUMB TARGETER. AND NOW I SUGGEST YOU DELETE THE GAME. BECAUSE ALL THE PLAYERS WHO HAVE SEEN THE STREAM WILL KILL YOU THE FIRST CHANCE THEY GET.

***11 straykidz (Ritualist) has fled from the village.***

**2 Jumana:** Brainless female.

**1 GLITCH:** No more than 3.

**3 zephyte:** Would you do this to me, 1? We loved each other! We were happy!

**1 GLITCH:** You betrayed me.

**3 zephyte:** That's not true at all. I had no idea who he was to you. And it doesn't change the fact that he's incomparable to you. There was nothing unusual about him. And you're the most wonderful friend anyone could ever have. You always made me smile when we played and talked. And you treated me like no one else could.

**3 zephyte:** Yes, I made a mistake that I regret. You were jealous of me because you loved me. And that jealousy only showed that you cared for me very much. I didn't realize that at all. I should have stopped giving you a reason to be so, and told you about my friends.

**3 zephyte:** I *love* you, Vitaly. And I know that deep down, you love me too. Please, let's start again with a clean slate.

Vitaly froze and stared blankly at the wall, remembering all the happy moments with Gokce. His excellent memory allowed him to remember every single one of them. So many times the girl had lifted his spirits. When he had something exciting ahead, he remembered her. When he needed motivation, he remembered her. When he wondered what he was living for, he remembered her.

And no matter how hard he tried, he couldn't remember a single bad moment. Nothing that made him angry or resentful. Absolutely nothing.

He couldn't keep the tears from welling up in his eyes. 

**1 GLITCH:** I love you too...

**2 Jumana:** Vitaly? Come to your senses! Would you endanger the project we've been working on for 6 months because of her?

**1 GLITCH:** *Abigail...* She was my whole life. What if I made a mistake?

**2 Jumana:** The mistake you're making right now. You don't forget a fellow countryman you met in this game. Especially if the two of them are of different genders. They'll never be able to not make up. And when they do, she'll leave you.

**3 zephyte:** It doesn't make any difference to me. I thought it was cool at first. But I can't help it that I'm losing interest in 6. I love 1 more. And I only want to be with him.

**2 Jumana:** 1, don't even think she's telling the truth. I was the one who pulled you out of depression when you were drowning in it. I saved you and gave you a new meaning to life. We were very good friends. I never gave you any reason to doubt my feelings. And I never forgot to remind you how much I liked you. While she didn't care at all.

**3 zephyte:** Why would you say that? I was always happy when he accepted my invitations or sent me messages. And I always showed it. I told him what a great friend he was, how important he was to me, and that I wanted to see him. I would send him love reels. I always believed in him and supported him in everything. And I reciprocated all his compliments to me.

**2 Jumana:** All your attention to him is based on reciprocity. But can you name a time when you told him you loved him *for no reason*? When he didn't send you anything, but you decided to do it yourself so he would be sure of it? You knew how attached he was to you and that he cared about you a lot! But you did nothing to reassure him!

While the girls were arguing, Vitaly took off his headphones, stepped away from the computer, and pressed his palms to his face. He got dizzy. He could feel his thoughts struggling inside him about whether to go back to Gokce or believe Abigail. He paced around the room, thinking about what to do. The heartache was tearing him apart. He adopted a lying down position and did a hundred push-ups to beat it with physical pain. His arms and legs began to shake and he collapsed without strength.

With difficulty, he got up, walked to his computer, and without sitting down at his chair, wrote.

**1 GLITCH:** Sorry, 2...

**2 Jumana:** Vitaly...

**1 GLITCH:** Sorry, Sorry... I can't do this...

The sound of the gong hit Vitaly's ears. He slowly moved the cursor over to Jumana. And clicked.

**2 Jumana:** Understood you.

Abigail voted him.

*Gokce did the same.*

Vitaly was puzzled.

**1 GLITCH:** Wait... But why are you both voting me?

No one answered him. Then he looked at the command line.

**1 GLITCH:** Prediction screen is blank... The program can't see this chain of events... Its chance is too low... So low that it wasn't even foreseen... It's... It's *impossible...*

The next two messages came in one second.

**2 Jumana:** Goodbye, Vitaly.

**3 zephyte:** Goodbye, Vitaly.

And he was executed.

### DAY 6

**3 zephyte:** We two could have been the Gods of this game.  But you were too weak. You were willing to destroy everything we did for a pathetic female.

**3 zephyte:** Except all through the game, she was me.

**3 zephyte:** Three days ago, when we were discussing the disclosure of our project, I remembered that all your past plans were ruined by love. It was your biggest problem, causing you to make mistakes that cost you all your efforts. And I had to make sure you were no longer affected by it. To do that, I decided to use Gokce, your former best friend. I hacked into her game account using the same methods we used on tanimaaaa six months ago.

**3 zephyte:** On another device, I logged into her account and joined this lobby. I pretended to be the real Gokce and acted plausible. Before that, I read all her chats, including those with you and Sanjit, so everything I wrote wasn't a lie. I knew everything about you two. That's why no one suspected a thing. And my decision to test you was the right one. You betrayed me and our project.

**3 zephyte:** We could have been together, but now it's over between us. I don't need you anymore. I took revenge on my betrayers and took full control of the game. The source code for the project is saved on my computer so I can work on it myself. You have access to it too, but there's no way you can improve it without me. I know machine learning much better than you do. And I'm the only one who knows how it fits into this project.

**3 zephyte:** You know, Gokce actually loved you. Messages to that effect filled her chat with Sanjit. Damn, I wish you could have seen them... She was in so much pain and wanted you back, and you didn't even know it. But it doesn't matter. You two will never be happy together. Because before the game started, I spent all her gold and roses, shuffled all her outfits, deleted all her friends, and left a note in her bio on your behalf saying you hate her and want to end it forever.

**3 zephyte:** You were a good teacher, for which I'm immensely grateful. But you were too weak. And that weakness has taken everything from you. Now you're not only a nobody to your favorite girl, but also to this game. I became her only God, and in this live stream I proved that no one can defeat me. As predicted in the beginning, the killer won. I, 3, was the grave robber, whose target was *you*.

**3 zephyte:** Thank you for everything. And now...

**3 zephyte:** GAME OVER.

***The village has killed 2 Jumana (Flagger).***

***3 zephyte wins. They are the Bomber!***
