**...**

I love cold. And I think it's best to tie my death to it. That's why I'm standing on the city bridge now, about five hundred meters from its beginning, right in front of the fence.

It's nightfall. The tears on my face are hidden by the drizzling rain, and the headwind blows in my face. There is not a single stranger nearby to notice me. I stare at the watery abyss of the river, one of the largest in the world. It was as dark as my soul, and the waves rising above it rumbled like thoughts in my head.

***Without you, life has no meaning...***

I climbed over the fence and stood on the edge.

***But if I kill myself, I'll end it all without even trying to get you back...***

***I have nothing left to lose. I can die now, or later, when we talk. When I confess my feelings and apologize for everything.***

***I love you, Gokce.***

***I will find you.***

And I took a step.

*Backwards.*

Tumbling sideways over the pillar, fell to the ground.

***The game goes on.***
