### DAY 2

In the middle of the night, the bomb exploded and killed three players: 4 — headhunter, 8 — flower child, and 12 — doctor.

The werewolves tried to kill someone, but their attack was redirected by a flagger to player number 5, who turned out to be a junior werewolf.

His death was avenged, and 2, that very flagger, left with him.

**1 GLITCH:** Hatred has ruined you, 2 and 5. You two died as I had predicted.

**16 Suzuha:** Is this true? 

**6 disappointed:** I just logged into Discord and found the live stream. He's telling the truth. Back in the voting phase, there was a message posted about the imminent death of all these players. If we had known about the broadcast from the beginning, we could have avoided their deaths.

**16 Suzuha:** But 2 told us about it?

**6 disappointed:** Yes, she did. But when that info roles confusion started, she got distracted by it, and didn't notice the predictions. When she texted us about them, there were ten seconds left, and nothing we could do.

**1 GLITCH:** You're good at finding your mistakes. But do you know how to learn from them?

**6 disappointed:** Of course I do. I've opened the stream in another window, and I'm gonna keep my eyes on it.

**1 GLITCH:** Good decision. But made too late. I'm making it harder for you.

**6 disappointed:** How?

Sanjit shifted his gaze to the video. The command line was no longer there.

**6 disappointed:** But why? 

**1 GLITCH:** I gave you plenty of time to use my predictions and try to change your destiny. Now you know all about my program , and that makes it useless. So I'm depriving you of that privilege.

**6 disappointed:** That's fine. You don't stand a chance anyway.

**1 GLITCH:** Btw, here's a question. Do I need to talk about the fact that I am the hacker? That I am Vitaly? Or have you already figured that out? 

**6 disappointed:** I knew it and never doubted.

**1 GLITCH:** And Jakob? Or is he dumber than you?

**6 disappointed:** He knew it too. Furthermore, when you pretended you weren't the hacker, he messaged me on Instagram saying he didn't believe you. I replied that I totally agree with that.

**3 zephyte:** Are you... Really Vitaly?

**1 GLITCH:** Imagine that. I tricked you. I don't care if you recognize me or not, because you're nothing to me. I suffered from depression for a long time because of you. But I've found a new purpose for which I live.

**6 disappointed:** To destroy this game? But as far as I know, that's always been your goal?

**1 GLITCH:** Don't worry, it's different. Destroying this game is just a side effect.

**6 GLITCH:** Then what's the primary goal?

**1 GLITCH:** I have someone in my life who respects and understands me.

**6 disappointed:** A new lover?

**1 GLITCH:** Not a lover. A friend. Just like me.

**1 GLITCH:** She told me her story. And honestly, nothing in my life has ever made me sympathetic. But this... Few things could be worse than this.

**1 GLITCH:** This is the saddest story I've ever heard. Dumb idiots like 6 and 7 will never understand it.

**6 disappointed:** Everyone has bad events in life. Everyone experiences sadness. You are just plain selfish people who think you are the most miserable people on the planet.

**1 GLITCH:** 6.

**6 disappointed:** Yes?

**1 GLITCH:** Have you seen the movie "The Joker"?

Voting time.

***The ritualist revived 2 Jumana.***

**6 disappointed:** I did. So?

**1 GLITCH:** ** I'm the Joker in this game.**

**1 GLITCH:** Welcome back, 2!

**2 Jumana:** Thank you, ritualist!

**2 Jumana:** Hi, 1!

**6 disappointed:** I'll just reveal your role now and we'll lynch you. You think I don't know you're the killer?

**1 GLITCH:** Will you do it with four werewolves in the game? You have a chance to win. The bomber knows the numbers of the werewolves, and he definitely planted the bomb for them. You'll get your revenge on him later.

**6 disappointed:** Stop saying the word "bomber" like it's not you! 

**1 GLITCH:** I'll help you, 6. Reveal 9's role. Trust me.

**6 disappointed:** When the bomb goes off, I promise we'll kill you!

***The vigilante has revealed the role of 9 rwylm (Stubborn werewolf).***

**1 GLITCH:** Goodbye.

The villagers voted for 9, and the stubborn werewolf was wounded.
