## 1 HOUR AFTER THE GAME

<br>

I love cold. And I think it's best to tie my death to it. That's why I'm standing on the city bridge now, about five hundred meters from its beginning, right in front of the fence.

It's nightfall. The tears on my face are hidden by the drizzling rain, and the headwind blows in my face. There is not a single stranger nearby to notice me. I stare at the watery abyss of the river, one of the largest in the world. It was as dark as my soul, and the waves rising above it rumbled like thoughts in my head. I forgave all my enemies in this game, and the game itself for what it had done to my life. It had ceased to bother me. For today, I had lost the most precious thing I had. I lost the meaning of my life.

This morning, Wolvesville was supposed to be destroyed. The project *we* had been working on for three months was finished. When we started its testing, it performed beautifully, and that meant taking complete control of this game. But as you can see, I'm not happy about that at all. Because I had no idea how it would end. I created a new villain who continued my work. But I never suspected her plan against me.

Dear players, fear me not. You will never see me anymore. But you should fear another person who has become *the true God* of this game.
