### DAY 4

During the night, 13, a wounded tough guy, died. The bomber blew up 14, wolf seer, and 15, guardian wolf.

The werewolves killed 6, vigilante. Along with him died 16, the ghost-lady who was attached to him.

**1 GLITCH:** Goodbye, 16. I'm sorry to see it go. If you knew about the stream, you wouldn't have protected 6 and have gotten attached to him.

**1 GLITCH:** But there's no need to be sad. Even if you didn't, my program would have adapted and come up with other predictions.

**9 rwylm:** How do you do it? What's the secret behind the program?

**1 GLITCH:** Artificial intelligence.

**9 rwylm:** Artificial intelligence?

**1 GLITCH:** *2, tell her.*

**9 rwylm:** Wh... What? Really? 2? So you're with him? You're his accomplice?

**2 Jumana:** Always have been.

Suddenly it hit 9.

**9 rwylm:** I remember you... Both of you... It's like we've met before... A long time ago...

Memories of the past flashed through the girl's mind, and she realized everything.

**9 rwylm:** I was a detective. 1 acted like an idiot and spammed all the time. When we died, he started making fun of me and writing dumb messages. Then 2 joined him. That's when you two became friends...

**2 Jumana:** That's right. We found each other in that game.

**1 GLITCH:** Thanks to her, my depression disappeared. She became a friend who would love and understand me. She became the meaning of my life. One day she told me that she dreamed of becoming a programmer and a hacker. So I taught her everything I know myself.

**9 rwylm:** But why would you need that? If you got the best friend you so desperately wanted? If you got to be happy?

**1 GLITCH:** *I* don't need it. But she does. It was entirely her idea to create the project for this game.

**9 rwylm:** 2... Why..?

<br>

**...** 

**A: Look... I want to offer you a collaborative program.**

**Corruptor: A collaborative program? I thought there was nothing you couldn't create on your own.**

**A: This program will require your mind.**

**Corruptor: Well, I'd love to help you create it! But I wonder what my mind has to do with it?**

**A:**

**About a year ago, I met a player I really liked. We played every day, and we could talk about anything. He loved my energy, my activity in the game. The insane way I acted. How I was ruining the game, random killing, spamming in chat, overall annoying the players. With my friend, I could be myself. I didn't care what anyone else thought. It was just me and him in the universe.**

**Until one day he introduced me to a girl. She was four years older, and she looked just like me. Also insane. But her personality was a little different. She was never boring. And I don't mean playing, but socializing. Her life itself was more interesting than mine. She would often tell me about events, stories, classes, and other things. That was the problem. I was a strong introvert, and only expressed myself in the game. Whereas she was an extrovert with a real life.**

**That's probably why he started spending more time with her. His invitations came to me less and less often, and soon stopped altogether. At one point, I noticed that he deleted me from friends. The same thing happened on all the social networks we were communicating on. I looked for him in games and tried to contact him there, but it was in vain. He said he didn't want to see me anymore and ignored all my subsequent messages.**

**The last time this happened, I decided to forget about him. But two days later something happened that left me in complete shock. I was banned for three months due to inappropriate behavior. Despite the fact that usually my bans were for a maximum of three days, and there weren't many players who reported me lately. But I knew right away what was wrong.**

**When we first met, he told me that he wanted to become a game's Discord Helper. There were no vacancies, so he was waiting for one to apply for. And after one month he wrote me that he got it. He got a position as a helper. Of course, after being there for a long time, he made new friends among the staff, including the Guardians. And that's when he took advantage of his position.**

**I appealed, but all the evidence given to me was meritorious. Moreover, I remembered all the games for which I received a report. Just like I remembered that it was always both of those idiots in them all. Apparently, when I misbehaved, they secretly reported me. And then he texted his Guardian friend to give me the harshest punishment possible. That's how I got the maximum ban.**

**There was nothing I could do about it. I deleted the game. And took up other activities, focusing on what I really needed. I improved my grades, started living a healthy lifestyle, and found a few hobbies. But it was impossible to forget this game forever. So when the ban expired, I reinstalled the game. And started fresh.**

**...**

<br>

**2 Jumana:** *Jalous* and *tanimaaaa* were those very players.

**2 Jumana:** A few months later, I met Vitaly. And a few more months later, I told him my story. We trusted each other to the core. That's when he confessed to me that he was the hacker who had nearly destroyed the entire game. And told me his story from beginning to end.

**2 Jumana:** My thirst for revenge was reborn. But by then, I was already a professional programmer. And I came up with a new, better idea that would infallibly predict players behavior, making us the gods of the game.

**9 rwylm:** But what does mind 1 have to do with it? You said that this program needed his mind...

**2 Jumana:** 1 is very smart. A lot of people underestimated him in that regard and didn't realize how smart he really is. Without any programs, he thought out games down to the last detail. Knew every action. Knew what it could lead to. Knew every probability. He knew everything.

**2 Jumana:** Yes, he was always beaten. But how? By absurdities that even the smartest man on the planet couldn't think through. Everyone who defeated him was just lucky. Normally, they wouldn't stand a chance against him.

**2 Jumana:** The artificial intelligence we created thinks like him. We have, you might say, translated his brain into a program. Only it's better. It won't make any mistakes or miscalculations. After all, a machine is always faster and more accurate than a human.

**9 rwylm:** But artificial intelligence has to learn from and analyze something. What input data does your program take? And where did you get the training data?

**2 Jumana:** Remember his last plan? Which was to use a bot farm?

**9 rwylm:** Yes, I do, and so?

**2 Jumana:** Those bots were not only performing the task of creating chaos. They were given another, parallel task.

**9 rwylm:** What was it?

**2 Jumana:** Each bot collected data about the game and the players involved. Everything was recorded: roles, actions, messages, roses, emojis, votes, stats, and more. Over the course of its existence, the bots collected so much of this data that the model learned to perfectly predict players behaviors and roles. Based on these predictions, a special algorithm drew up possible chains of events and ways to control them. With every second the program became more and more accurate, and no one could trick it.

The timer announced the start of voting, and the residents repeated their choice of 9.

**9 rwylm:** Why is tanimaaaa, that friend of Jalous, not with us? What happened to her?

**2 Jumana:** Are you sure you want to know?
