### DAY 3

**2 Jumana:** I'm the grave robber. My target was 12, so yesterday I became a doctor. I knew the werewolves would want to kill 6 because the ghost-lady was attached to him. If they did a double kill, the werewolves would be in the majority. They would have easily lynched the bomber and won. And I was right. I saved him that night.

**1 GLITCH** Thank you, 2! I'm the ghost-lady, and I actually saved him. If it wasn't for you, we'd be dead!

**16 Suzuha:** A complete lie. The ghost-lady is me. And he's probably the bomber.

**13 Blueb3rry:** Yeah, he really is a bomber. I'm a tough guy. He tried to plant a bomb for me.

**6 disappointed:** Only an idiot wouldn't understand that.

**1 GLITCH:** Despite this, I'm still alive. Why do you think that is? Well, because you need me! Because you, 6, need to outsmart everyone! You have to prove once again that I can't take control of this game!

**6 disappointed:** Are you saying that revealing your own role was part of the plan?

**1 GLITCH:** Wait... What? A plan? Do I have a plan?

Vitaly paused. Convinced that 6 had nothing to say, he continued.

**1 GLITCH:** I don't have a plan! Have you forgotten? The post explicitly stated that I'm doing all of this with no preparation! I walked into a completely random lobby and couldn't calculate anything in advance! I'm just predicting your actions!

**6 disappointed:** You're a psychopath...

**1 GLITCH:** Me? Oh, no. I'm not a psychopath. But you and your dumb friends are. You're trying to save the *glitch* of this world. You can't realize that this game is changing lives too much. And the problem is, not just for the good, but for the bad.

**1 GLITCH:** I'M TRYING TO SAVE EVERYONE!!! NOT YOU!!! I AM!!! I'M TRYING TO PUT THE TRUTH INTO YOUR DUMB BRAINS!!! I'M WORRIED ABOUT EVERY SINGLE PERSON THAT THIS GAME HAS BECOME A PART OF THEIR LIVES!!! IT WILL RUIN THEM AND THEY DON'T REALIZE IT!!! I AM THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN HELP THEM AND MAKE THEM HAPPY!!!

**6 disappointed:** You are the one who ruined your life, not the game.

**1 GLITCH:** It gave me the love of my life and then ruthlessly took it away. If it wasn't for that game, I would have had another hobby. I could have found another place where I was better than everyone else and shown society that they underestimated me. I could have found another love. But I stumbled into this damn game, and all my dreams came crashing down.

**3 zephyte:** I loved and understood you, Vitaly. You put your own spin on it, that others were more important to me. But you were my best friend.

**1 GLITCH:** I know the three of you went into this game. Neither 6 nor 7 said hello to you. Besides, you play rarely and mostly just for quests. So it's impossible that they would randomly come into the game with you, and me as well. That's self-explanatory.

**3 zephyte:** I wish that was true.

**1 GLITCH:** What's the truth then?

**6 disappointed:** She blocked me for absolutely no reason and stopped talking to me.

Even someone like Vitaly was perplexed by this situation.

**1 GLITCH:** But why?

**6 disappointed:** Because her mind is so... Weird. I don't know how I didn't see it before.

**3 zephyte:** What haven't you noticed? And Ð½here's nothing weird about my mind.

**6 disappointed:** You're in a constant state of depression and you don't want to change. I know you're isolated, hard to socialize with people, and unable to make new friends. And it's sad that your best friend left school, because she was the only one who cared about you and loved for who you are.

**6 disappointed:** But you're not trying to make your life better! You don't move on! You don't do any activities, you have no hobbies, and you're afraid to look for them! All you do every day is watch reels on Instagram, watch movies, and read your useless books! You're not doing anything useful! And you're always texting me about being depressed and wanting to die!

**6 disappointed:** You don't realize you're not the only one in the world! There are people who are afraid of society! There are people who have lost people they care about! There are people who have been betrayed! There are people who have had worse fates than you! But they all go on living! And I'm sick of hearing about it! I can't talk and play with you anymore!

Sanjit took a breath as he poured out all his tormented feelings.

**1 GLITCH:** I'm shocked... 3, is it true?

**3 zephyte:** That friend meant a lot to me.

**1 GLITCH:** I understand you because I know what it's like to lose friends. Gradually I was abandoned by all my friends and acquaintances. Among them was my best friend who I had been friends with since 4th grade. But it was worse with me. I was left because I... I was different. I was too insane for them. They didn't understand me. They treated me like an idiot, thinking I didn't get it. But I always understood everything and knew I was smarter.

There was a gong.

**3 zephyte:** You never told me about this...

**1 GLITCH:** Didn't want to show my weakness.

**6 disappointed:** What do you mean you were too insane? What did you do that made them stop being friends with you?

**1 GLITCH:** It doesn't matter. I'm not the old Vitaly anymore. I'M **GLITCH*.

The villagers pointed out the number 9, the stubborn werewolf, on their signs.

**9 rwylm:** You do realize he's been thinking this through for a long time, right? You realize he's gonna win? There are hundreds of thousands of players watching this game, and they all know his plan. Don't think you're in control. He'll always be one step ahead.

**1 GLITCH:** Don't worry, they've already accepted their fate. And that's what I suggest you do.

**9 rwylm:** You were nothing, you're still nothing. And you'll never get this game.

**1 GLITCH:** Look how attached you are. It's had too much influence on you to let it go. Be angry at me, that's fine. But pretty soon I'll turn this game into hell and everyone will be saved.

**9 rwylm:** You're just a loser who craves the attention of others. And taking from others what made you miserable through your own fault.

**1 GLITCH:** But *right now* I'm taking something else away from you.

**9 rwylm:** What?

**1 GLITCH:** Your life.

Time was up and the villagers tried to execute 9, but they failed because she was saved.
