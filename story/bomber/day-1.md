### DAY 1

No one died on the first night, which meant the werewolves couldn't kill their target. The bomber, who turned out to be the killing role, planted their bomb.

**7 check_me:** 3 IS GOOD.

**5 Jalous:** 3 AND 16 ARE RED.

**10 Weaver_:** SPIRIT SEER HERE. 11 OR 15 KILLED SOMEONE LAST NIGHT.

**4 Kami01:** 9 IS THE GUARDIAN WOLF. I'M SEER.

**1 GLITCH:** Hi all!

**2 Jumana:** Hi, 1!

**16 Suzuha:** Hi!

**3 zephyte:** Hello!

**1 GLITCH:** How are you all doing?

**3 zephyte:** Everything's great!

**2 Jumana:** Fine. What about you?

**16 Suzuha:** Could be better. Thank you.

**1 GLITCH:** I feel the same as 1. But I'm most happy for 16. And I'd advise you to tone it down a bit yourself.

**16 Suzuha:** Why? 

**1 GLITCH:** Because I'm about to ruin your mood.

**2 Jumana:** What makes you say that?

**1 GLITCH:** I know the outcome of this game from the get-go. No matter what you do, it's going to go exactly the way I planned. That's why you won't enjoy the game.

**16 Suzuha:** What makes you so sure?

**1 GLITCH:** Because I read it all a long time ago.

**2 Jumana:** Seriously, 1? Don't make me laugh.

**6 disappointed:** I think I recognize someone...

**1 GLITCH:** Dead serious. Why not?

**1 GLITCH:** Who do you recognize, 6? I'm one of a kind.

**2 Jumana:** There was a predictor like that before. He almost destroyed the game and beat everyone, but in the end he was beaten like nothing.

**6 disappointed:** He acted exactly like 1. Just as insane and selfish. I know because I've been in this psycho's games myself. We and my friends saved it.

**3 zephyte:** Are you talking about the hacker? 

**2 Jumana:** Yes, him.

**16 Suzuha:** Hacker? Who's that?

**16 GLITCH:** Damn, I look at 2 and 16, and I realize there are only two types of people: those who know about me, and those who don't.

**2 Jumana:** Are you completely out of touch, 16?

**16 Suzuha:** I took a one week break, and I'm back from it today.

**2 Jumana:** I take it you're not on the official Discord server either?

**16 Suzuha:** I don't even have Discord installed.

**2 Jumana:** I see. Well, it's probably for the best.

**7 check_me:** What happened on that server? I don't get on there much, so I don't know about the latest news.

**6 disappointed:** Same situation.

**2 Jumana:** You better see for yourself. What he's up to is completely insane.

**16 Suzuha:** Can you summarize it? I'm very interested, but it's inconvenient to see now.

**2 Jumana:** Yesterday, in the feedback section, one person made a post where he announced that he was able to calculate the outcome of any game without preparation. He explained in detail what a terrible game Wolvesville is and why it shouldn't exist. Along with telling a huge story about how it destroyed his life, and how he got the idea to do to it what it did to him.

**2 Jumana:** He had been working on his project for six months, and now it's working perfectly. He wanted to prove to everyone that he wasn't lying, and for that purpose, decided to do a live stream. In front of everyone, he wanted to go into a random lobby and with the help of the program beat everyone.

**2 Jumana:** A link to it has been added at the end of this text. Also attached was a video of him burning pictures of the developers. I guess that's how he wanted to show the severity of his intentions.

**16 Suzuha:** And what's going on in this stream?

**2 Jumana:** There's a game opened on it. *This* game. And the command line, which displays all the information about the game, the result of its complete analysis, and the predictions of all possible chains of events and roles.

**16 Suzuha:** It's incredible...

**7 check_me:** Right, insane. But hopeless. You shouldn't be afraid of people like him. They sound like professionals, but in reality, they're clueless. He's not gonna do anything to you.

**1 GLITCH:** Dare to check?

**7 check_me:** Honestly, I have no idea what new idea you could come up with that the hacker didn't use that would work.

**6 disappointed:** Are you the hacker yourself by any chance? Maybe you're just pretending to be his follower and making another pathetic attempt to beat everyone?

**1 GLITCH:** I'm not the hacker. He's a thing of the past. I'm much better than him.

**7 check_me:** Let's check it out. But first, what's your goal in this game?

**1 GLITCH:** My goal is to show that I'm its God.

**7 check_me:** But how do you want to do it? By winning?

**1 GLITCH:** In this game, the killer wins. I want to show you that I knew that from the beginning. But that doesn't mean it's me.

**7 check_me:** Look, I'm not gonna play games with you. I'm gonna check you out the very next night.

**1 GLITCH:** I don't mind.

**7 check_me:** Don't act like it's okay. I'm sure right now, in life, you're trembling with fear, praying that I'm dead and no one will ever know your role.

**1 GLITCH:** You can think that way if you like it.

**16 Suzuha:** I suggest we get back in the game and see if he can do it or not!

**1 GLITCH:** That's a great idea. Let's start by figuring out who the seer is.

**7 check_me:** Are you stupid? You don't realize I'm the seer?

**1 GLITCH:** But 4 doesn't think so.

**4 Kami01:** What the hell kind of seer are you? A seer of your own dumbness? I'm seer and I gave my information a long time ago: 9 is a guardian wolf.

**7 check_me:** Are you serious? Okay. Let me get rid of you quickly. 3 is a grave robber. Confirm it, please.

**3 zephyte:** Not like that.

**7 check_me:** What?

**3 zephyte:** I'm not a grave robber.

**4 Kami01:** As you can see, 7.

**7 check_me:** You... You... What the hell are you doing? Do you recognize what you're doing?

**3 zephyte:** Do your eyes recognize what you're checking?

**7 check_me:** 9, say something! There's no way you're really a guardian wolf!

About ten seconds came, but the girl didn't answer.

**7 check_me:** Slut.

**4 Kami01:** Okay, the case has come to an end. The headhunter has been found. Spirit seers, would you be so kind as to repeat your information?

**10 Weaver_:** 11 and 15 are red.

**5 Jalous:** Pathetic liar. I'm spiritual seer. 3 and 16 are red.

**10 Weaver_:** That's a completely false statement.

**5 Jalous:** What's the right one? That you sucked my rod?

**10 Weaver_:** Oh no, I don't do it as well as you.

**2 Jumana:** I don't believe 5. He always acts like that when he's a werewolf.

**5 Jalous:** What do you want from me?

**2 Jumana:** Your death.

**5 Jalous:** Pity, but it's all yours. Including your loss.

**2 Jumana:** Coming from a werewolf who's about to die.

**5 Jalous:** No one's gonna kill me.

**1 GLITCH:** Sorry to interrupt your conversation... But I'm willing to take issue with that comment.

**4 Kami01:** Certainly. I don't think I need to remind you that we lynch 7, and shoot 10?

**10 Weaver_:** Me? Why me?

Voting has begun, and all the villagers have chosen 7.

**7 check_me:** Dumb apes.

**2 Jumana:** Omg...

**1 GLITCH:** I understand you 2, I'm shocked at 7 too.

**2 Jumana:** That's not what I'm talking about! I'm talking about the stream! Look at it!

**7 check_me:** Damn! I left Discord to update, but I totally forgot about it because I was talking to you retards! Can you tell me what it is, 2?

*10...*

**2 Jumana:** I didn't even notice it because I was distracted by you myself!

*9...*

**2 Jumana:** But now I looked, and it turns out that even in the very beginning, he calculated the time and cause of death of three players!

*8...*

**2 Jumana:** The first prediction was that on the first night 6 would be saved from a werewolf attack.

*7...*

**2 Jumana:** Second prediction: the villagers would kill 7 on day one.

*6...*

**2 Jumana:** And the third: the vigilante will shoot 5.

*5...*

**7 check_me:** How's that possible?

*4...*

It's only now that they realized.

**2 Jumana:** We're doing whatever he wants...

*3...*

**7 check_me:** 6, DON'T SHOOT!!!

But it was too late. Sanjit shot 10, the spirit seer.

*2...*

**7 check_me:** NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!

*1...*

**1 GLITCH:** Game over.

***The village has killed 7 check_me (Seer).***

**Jumana:** And for the rest of us, it's just begun... Because the next night, five players will die. And he's known them for a long time.
