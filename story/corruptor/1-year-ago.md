In the evening, after studying, cruel was somewhat tired. She decided to play her favorite game Wolvesville with her friend. After putting her things away, she sat on her bed and opened the game on her phone.

— Looks like Jakob is offline, — cruel thought. Well, I'll play alone. Anyway, there's one task left in the Battle Pass that I can do.

With a little sadness, the girl clicked on *"Game"*, selecting *"Sandbox"* mode. She got number 1, since she was the first to join the room. Fairly quickly all 16 players were joined. They were a wide variety of people. Many had interesting skins. As cruel looked at them, the game began.

Seeing the role that was given to her, she was not very happy. Because it didn't seem very interesting to her. Without her friend, the girl often fleed away from the village, because she saw no point in playing with an uninteresting role and without friends. But this time she decided to play.

— Okay, it was nothing. It could have been worse.
