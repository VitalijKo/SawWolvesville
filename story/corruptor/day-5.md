### DAY 5

The werewolves killed number 12, the priest.

**4 The_Loki:** Well, here we are all alone, silly girl.

**16 cruel:** Bastard... 7 is corrupted, isn't it?

**4 The_Loki:** 7, answer her. Are you corrupted or not?

As expected, there was no answer.

**4 The_Loki:** As you can see.

**16 cruel:** This can't be... You literally said from day one that you're a corruptor, but no one did anything about it... Everything went exactly as you predicted... How is that possible?

**4 The_Loki:** I told you girl, I've been preparing for this day for 1 month. I calculated under what circumstances I could win as corruptor. I calculated the odds of this game for one of the outcomes, and the odds were almost 100%. I knew how this game would go. I knew every move. And I was one step ahead of everyone.

**4 The_Loki:** I'm the god of this game, 16. Not just this game. Of all Wolvesville. I'll carry on my work. Everyone will play by my rules.

**16 cruel:** You're a sick egocentric... I can definitely say that about you.

**4 The_Loki:** I think you mean I'm smart.

**16 cruel:** A lucky bastard obsessed with power. That's all.

**4 The_Loki:** Silly, silly, silly girl...

**16 cruel:** STOP CALLING ME GIRL!

**4 The_Loki:** Goodbye.

Voting has begun. It was supposed to be over in 30 seconds.

**16 cruel:** Please, vote for me at once... I want to die quickly...

**4 The_Loki:** As you wish. 

That's what he did. Half the time they were just silent. The mystery player was enjoying the triumph and saw no reason to write anything. He knew he had won. And no one could stop him.

**16 cruel:** You know, bastard, you didn't think it through. Not everything went according to your plan.

**4 The_Loki:** Like what?

**16 cruel:** Think about it. You're the smartest one in this game.

There was silence for about 5 seconds. Finally an answer followed:

**4 The_Loki:** I don't know what you mean.

*10...*

**16 cruel:** What did you think my role was?

*9...*

**4 The_Loki:** Belonging to the werewolf team!

*8...*

**16 cruel:** Which one?

*5...*

**4 The_Loki:** Wolf seer or guardian wolf. But I think guardian wolf was 7, so most likely you're a wolf seer.

*4...*

**16 cruel:** Are you sure?

*3...*

The moments of the game began to flash before the Loki's eyes. He remembered every role that was played, every ability used, every player died, straining his brain as hard as he could, trying to understand what cruel was talking about.

*2...*

And suddenly, he realized one thing...

**Junior werewolf.**

*1...*

As fast as he could, Loki brought his finger to the phone screen and pressed it, but not in time. The voting was over.

**16 cruel:** GAME OVER.

The girl turned out to be a junior werewolf. She chose 4, and he died with her.

Since the corruptor died, the corruption of 7 expired and he stayed alive.

**The werewolves won.**

**4 The_Loki:** NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!
