### DAY 3

The werewolves killed a medium last night. It was player number 9. He knew he was likely to die, so revived the priest, player number 13. Also, after visiting the evil player, the red lady number 15 died.

**7 The_Loki:** Next victim: 11.

**1 cruel:** 16, YOU ARE THE ONLY ONE LEFT PLEASE DO SOMETHING!!! ASK THEM TO KILL THAT DAMN CORRUPTOR!!!

**6 ValkyValky:** I checked the medium with the good one. Vigilante, kill 10! And 13, tell me who the red lady visited.

**13 inkognito:** She visited 12.

Suddenly, the storm werewolf activated his ability. The players' numbers shuffled, the chat was completely cleared and votes were hidden.

**13 ValkyValky:** Damn... I don't remember who 10 was.

**16 cruel:** It was 4! The_Loki!

**4 The_Loki:** Are you sure? 

**16 cruel:** Don't pretend.

**4 The_Loki:** Besides, I'm just saying. The numbers got mixed up, and now player 16 is number 1. So he'll die next. Unless, of course, he figures out why I picked him.

**16 cruel:** DAMN!!! 1, WHY DON'T YOU SAY ANYTHING TO HIM???

**1 Lenny69:** OMG 16. Do you really think he's a hacker? I don't care about him. He's 100% just a fool. Perhaps coupled with a corruptor. Or a detective.

**1 Lenny69:** Or he's just a wolf and pretends to be a fool, and the hacker plays along to him to kill as many players as possible, and he hasn't been found.

At that moment, priest, number 6, threw water at 4. But he died himself. 4 wasn't a werewolf.

**16 cruel:** YOU DUMB! WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?

**13 ValkyValky:** OMG...

**13 ValkyValky:** Well, does that make 16 a wolf? I mean, you're the one who said he was the strom werewolf.

**16 cruel:** No, 4 isn't a werewolf! He's a corruptor! But you weren't paying any attention to him! I said that so he could be killed by a vigilante, and you saw that you were right! But in a ridiculous coincidence, a priest threw water at him!

Suddenly, one player sent a message.

**10 duskwolf:** Wait! I remember. I think his number was changed to 14.

The vigilante, who was now number 10, shot 14.

Turns out his role was bodyguard.

**13 ValkyValky:** This can't be happening....

**10 duskwolf:** So it turns out 13 is a fake detective?

**13 ValkyValky:** I gave the correct information from the beginning. There are two random wolves in the game. I think a wolf shaman is among them.

**10 duskwolf:** Yeah, it looks like it.

**13 ValkyValky:** So, there is one problem. The priest knew the person the red lady visited. His number was 12. But now it might have changed. We have no way of knowing who 12 was.

**1 Lenny69:** I think he's become 7.

**7 noellee:** No, I'm a flower child. I think it's 6.

Some amount of time has passed, but player number 6 still hasn't said anything.

**4 The_Loki:** I think I'll clear this up for you. He's corrupted. 

**13 ValkyValky:** I think 7 is lying and is actually a wolf. I don't quite remember who the real flower child was, but he could have been corrupted.

**7 noellee:** How's that? I claimed that role back on day one.

**13 ValkyValky:** We won't remember who said what on day one. Bye, 7.

**7 noellee:** NO!!! YOU'RE WRONG!!!

The player tried to prove that he was actually a flower child, but no one believed him. Everyone voted for him. But it turned out he was protected by someone, so he didn't die.

But then something happened that no one expected. A chain of unbelievable events began. Player 6 died of corruption. And he turned out to be a split werewolf. He was connected to 13, who died with him.

Everyone thought he was a detective. But when his role was revealed, everyone saw that he has been a fool all along. To add to the even bigger surprise, he was coupled with 10, the vigilante. And they died together.
