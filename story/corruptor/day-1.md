### DAY 1

During the night, the werewolves killed one player, number 13, whose role was priest. The day came, and as usual, cruel expected to see some information.

Within seconds there were several messages from the detective, the red lady, and other players who had decided to announce their role, such as flower child.

But it was the first message that caught the girl's attention. Sometimes there were obscure players in the game, who wrote some nonsense in the chat, spammed, insulted others. But now it was something very unusual.

**7 The_Loki:** 2 5 11 16. I want to play a game with you. Every day you will die one by one. You can stop it if you can guess why I chose you. The game has begun. First number in line to die: 2.

— Who's that Loki... — She was surprised. What's he up to? Why is he so sure of himself? He must be a random killer.

Cruel opened the role list and saw that corruptor was the solo killer.

— That's probably him.

Messages were pouring in from the chat. But no one was paying attention to the strange player. Everyone was discussing their information, who could be a wolf and who couldn't, not giving any importance to these messages. Only two players from his list wrote:

**5 Lysssi:** What do you mean? It's kind of a joke?

**16 Lenny69:** Wtf 7?

**11 Akalim:** 7 what is your role?

**7 The_Loki:** 11, you already know my role. And yes, 5, this is a joke you'll laugh to death about.

**5 Lysssi:** I doubt it.

**4 The_Loki:** I won't get in the way.

**5 Lysssi:** Thank you.

**1 cruel:** What's going on in this chat... I think he's the random killer. Lets vote 7.

The girl offered to lynch him, but at that moment the vigilante revealed the role of player number 3. He turned out to be cursed. The villagers decided to kill him.

Everyone started voting for him without listening to him. The girl was angry, but she sent another message.

**1 cruel:** OKAY, LYNCH 3. BUT WITCH, I WOULD SUGGEST YOU TO KILL 7.

All 14 remaining players voted to kill 3. The time for voting had expired. But someone activated the lynch protection and saved him. Player 11 sent his message at the last second, so no one had time to reply to him.

**11 Akalim:** I'M SORRY, I'M SORRY. JUST SUDDENLY HE'S A FOOL? IF THAT'S TRUE, WE'RE GOING TO LOSE. MAKE SENSE OF THIS SITUATION.

And at the end, player number 2 died because he was corrupted.

— So his intentions were serious. — She understood.

During the night, the witch killed player 3. So the girl's idea of killing 7 failed. 

— Damn...

The werewolves killed player number 8, who turned out to be the sheriff.
