### DAY 4

Only four players left: 1, 4, 12, 16. During the night, the werewolves tried to kill 12, but he was protected and did not die.

**4 The_Loki:** The last day and the last victim: 1.

**4 The_Loki:** As I predicted, absolutely everything went according to my plan. I had been preparing for this moment for about a month. I've been writing everything down and calculating the outcomes in which everything would go perfectly. And I achieved that. This is my game. Corruptor's game.

**16 cruel:** I hate you... I HATE YOU!!!

**16 cruel:** 1, why didn't you listen to me? Why didn't you? Why didn't you do anything?

**4 The_Loki:** She decided not to play my game. She thought I'd be found, that nothing would happen. Or that I was a fool. Or that I was pretending. Or that I was coupled. I don't know, but it doesn't matter.

**4 The_Loki:** I'd like to point out that she was the witch who protected 12 from you.

**16 cruel:** From me? What do you mean?

**4 The_Loki:** You don't have to pretend anymore.

**16 cruel:** Don't pretend what?

**4 The_Loki:** Are you kidding?

**7 noellee:** What is he talking about?

**4 The_Loki** Omg... It was all just your game.

**16 cruel:** What are you saying?

**4 The_Loki:** Girl, that's enough. Before the game started, you and I agreed that you would use the corruptor talismans and I would help you win. We agreed that I would draw everyone's attention away from you. We calculated everything and we did it all for you.

**16 cruel:** That's a lie! YOU'RE LYING!!!

**4 The_Loki:** I really like you. But I can't give you this win. It went too perfect, and I want to keep it going. Keep these games going. I'm gonna be the god of this game.

**16 cruel:** You pathetic, lying idiot.

**12 inkognito:** So all the werewolves are dead and only the corruptor is left?

**4 The_Loki:** Yes. And that's 16.

The voting has begun. 4 and 12 voted for 16, and 7 and 16 voted for 4.

**4 The_Loki:** 7, what are you doing? You don't want to win?

**7 noellee:** Go to hell.

**4 The_Loki:** Nothing. I think at least tomorrow you'll correct your mistake. Idiot.

**16 cruel:** 12, PLEASE DO IT. 4 IS A CORRUPTOR. HE'S A LIAR. HE'S BEEN A CORRUPTOR ALL ALONG!!!

**16 cruel:** HE'S PLAYING GOD. HE PRETENDS HE'S IN CONTROL, THAT HE'S GOT IT ALL FIGURED OUT. BUT LET'S SHOW HIM HE'S WRONG. THAT HE'S JUST A PATHETIC, WORTHLESS IDIOT.

**12 inkognito:** I'm sorry, 16. But I believe 4.

**16 cruel:** NO!!! NO!!! NO!!! NO!!!

But no one listened. The vote ended in a tie, and no one was killed. Only 1, who was corruptor, died at the end of the day.
