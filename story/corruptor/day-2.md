### DAY 2

The mysterious player once again sent the message first.

**7 The_Loki:** Next player: 5. You must guess what you have in common. Otherwise, the end will come to each of you.

This time the girl sent her message immediately afterward to get the attention of all the villagers.

**1 cruel:** Did you see that? 7 SAID HE WOULD KILL THEM. AND ONE OF THEM REALLY DIED. 5, SAY SOMETHING. IF HE DOESN'T SAY ANYTHING, IT MEANS HE'S CORRUPTED AND WILL DIE SOON.

She was answered by player number 6, who had the role of detective.

**6 ValkyValky:** Calm down.

The girl was angry but resigned to the villagers inaction, so simply wrote:

**1 cruel:** You'll regret your decision. You'll regret ignoring me.

Suddenly, one of the players decided to talk to Loki for a while.

**16 Lenny69:** Okay, 7. Our gender is different. Clans are different. The styles of the skins are different. There is no similarity in the names. It's not about the color of the skin, because in this case there would be more victims. I don't know what's the key.

**4 The_Loki:** Think about it, 16. Analyze every detail. I wouldn't give you an easy task. After all, it's a matter of life.

**16 Lenny69:** But we don't really have anything in common. Absolutely nothing. Somebody, tell him. That's right.

**14 duskwolf:** I agree. I look at you all, and I don't see anything. They are different in every way. I guess 7 is just mocking you. Maybe he's fool, that coupled with the corruptor, knows who he's going to kill, and plays with us, though there's no game.

**4 The_Loki:** Such reasoning will lead you straight to death.

**14 duskwolf:** You'd better not talk to me like that.

**4 The_Loki:** Why? Because you have a bullet I can get from you?

**14 duskwolf:** How do you know my role, bastard?

**1 cruel:** VIGILANTE, OMG, PLEASE SHOOT 7.

**6 ValkyValky:** Sorry, but we can't. We have a problem. I didn't mention it because you were discussing something of your own here. But now I'm saying it. Teams of 8 and 10 are different.

**6 ValkyValky:** We have to deal with those two for now. I think 8 is lying after all. Let's kill him.

**8 Skylune:** PLEASE DON'T, I'M JUST A DOCTOR. DON'T MAKE A MISTAKE.

**10 conti:** Shut your mouth, you goddamn swindler. I'M A BODYGUARD AND YOU'RE A WOLF.

The players argued until finally 8 died. He turned out to be a doctor.

Followed by a corruption that killed the player 5.

NO!!! — Cruel was out of control. — There are only 2 players left. 11 will be corrupted and won't be able to say anything. That leaves only 16, we'll have to work something out with him.
