**zephyte:** I love you, hacker.

**hack3r:** And I love you. You're the most beautiful person I've ever seen.

**zephyte:** Really? You're so cute!

**hack3r:** I'm very happy I didn't forget about you when I friended you on my first account.

**zephyte:** When I thought you were my clanmate?

**hack3r:** Yes. I was in a clan that had the same icon as yours. You thought I was in your clan, so you sent me a friend request.

**zephyte:** After that I invited you to play a few times for a few days, but you didn't come!

**hack3r:** But when I created this account, I remembered you, and sent you a friend request. You accepted it, and we talked for a bit, but you were acting a little weird.

**zephyte:** I wanted to be your cat!

**hack3r:** And you wanted me to kill you.

**zephyte:** You asked me the best way to do it. And I said you could burn me.

**hack3r:** I offered you to play, and told you that if I got the role of arsonist, I would do it. But you neither responded to me, nor did you accept my invitations.

**zephyte:** Until one day you wrote me an angry message, and I agreed to play with you.

**hack3r:** You've always been very unusual. And that's what I really like about you. You're like me. I love your personality. And I'm crazy about you.

**zephyte:** So sweet... I feel the same way about you.

**hack3r:** Most of all, I wish you were online more often... I miss you every day you're gone. Now that I know you're there, I can't play without you.

**zephyte:** Thank you! You know, I think we'll be able to play more often soon.

**hack3r:** I hope so. But there's still one problem I'm getting tired of.

**zephyte:** What's that?

**hack3r:** You always start the game as early as possible, and we don't have time to talk just to learn more about each other.

**zephyte:** Yeah, I'm just in a hurry... But we can talk in games.

**hack3r:** But there's a lot of players out there whose attention we don't need at all, especially in some areas.

**zephyte:** That's okay! They don't matter at all! In the game, we'll talk. I just have a few topics I want to discuss with you.

**hack3r:** Very interesting.

**zephyte:** Then we can start.

**hack3r:** Sure, but before we do, there's something I'd like to say.

**zephyte:** What?

**hack3r:** Let's not hide any secrets from each other. Because they're bound to come out. And when they do, we're all gonna be in **a lot of trouble**.
