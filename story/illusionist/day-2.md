### DAY 2

Night began, and the jailer arrested the fool. He talked to him for a few seconds and killed him. The werewolves, all of a sudden, killed the detective. And player number 13, the doctor who tried to protect him, died too. He was killed by a werewolf berserk.

**10 Pandacake:** Why didn't mediums revive gambler?

**14 bunny:** Hi everyone, I'm medium. I wanted to make sure there wasn't a werewolf berserk or toxic werewolf in the game, and wanted to wait before reviving.

**10 Pandacake:** You're a direct copy of goddamn 3. But unlike him, you turned out to be right, which I congratulate you on. Did you get the gambler's information?

**14 bunny:** 15 is in the werewolf team.

**10 pandacake:** Great. We're lynching him. 3, ask the players for their roles.

**3 check_me:** 2, role, please.

**2 Koame:** RRV.

**3 check_me:** 5, role, please.

At this point, the shadow werewolf manipulated today's vote.

**3 check_me:** Understood. Bye.

3 shot 5, and the shadow werewolf died.

**10 Pandacake:** It wasn't his best decision to stay silent.

**15 Illuminaughty:** He was probably just scared of dumb 3, who killed pacifist last time for some unknown reason. But either way, he had nothing to claim. He would have been counter claimed, the gunner would have killed him, and once the shadow was activated, no one would have believed him.

Suddenly 9 sent a message, but on a completely different topic.

**9 disappointed:** 1, why didn't you say hi to me?

**1 zephyte:** To you? Why? I'm only here for 6.

**6 hack3r:** Really?

**1 zephyte:** Yeah, 9 doesn't matter to me right now.

**9 disappointed:** I see you're in a bit of a mood, aren't you?

**1 zephyte:** 6, I suggest we get out of this game and go to another one and play alone.

**6 hack3r:** I'd like that very much. I really, really would. But I need to deal with all the idiots, and teach them a lesson.

**9 disappointed:** No, no. Now I can safely say that 6 will be in an even worse mood than 1.

**6 hack3r:** Why?

**9 disappointed:** The punishment system has just been updated. The number of guards has increased to one hundred. They will ban for any offense. And any appeals will not be considered. So until everything is finalized, they're only concentrating on bans.

**6 hack3r:** And what does that mean?

**9 disappointed:** And that the players who supported you will change their choices, and play normally. They were treated as normal, but from now on things are stricter, and players won't want to ruin the game anymore.

**6 hack3r:** Understood. Just why should it ruin my mood?

**9 disappointed:** Because you're the one who started it. Don't act like you don't care, because it's going to end soon. Even if half of the players get banned, the game will still exist.

**6 hack3r:** I have no idea what you're talking about.

**9 disappointed:** Yeah, well, there's a Guardian in the game. But it doesn't matter, because it's over.

**6 hack3r:** I know you're wrong.

**9 disappointed:** Why would you know?

**1 zephyte:** Why don't you stop hitting on my hacker, 9?

**9 disappointed:** You know, I'm tired of beating around the bush. Let's face it, I know what's going on. And I've already written to the developers about all the accounts involved.

**1 zephyte:** Really? What happened?

**9 disappointed:** He used similarly offended players, offering to ruin everyone's game.

**6 hack3r:** SERIOUSLY??? I'VE NEVER HEARD SUCH NONSENSE IN MY LIFE!!!

**9 disappointed:** Then what's really going on?

**6 hack3r:** THIS SYSTEM IS A LOT WORSE THAN YOUR DUMB BRAINS CAN UNDERSTAND!!!

**1 zephyte:** Are you okay, 6? How do you know that? Why did he make you so angry?

**6 hack3r:** I'VE BEEN TRYING TO SAVE THIS GAME, MY DEAR!!! I HAVE ANALYZED THE BEHAVIOR OF A HUGE NUMBER OF PLAYERS, TRYING TO IDENTIFY THE VARIOUS PATTERNS AND REASONS WHY THEY KEEP POPPING UP AND POPPING UP AND POPPING UP AND NEVER ENDING!!! I SPENT DAYS AND NIGHTS COMING UP WITH WAYS TO SOLVE THIS DAMN MYSTERY!!! BUT I COULDN'T!!! AND THIS HELPLESSNESS IS MAKING ME VERY VERY TORMENTED!!! NOW CAN YOU LET GO OF ME???

After Vitaly's speech, everyone fell silent, processing the information he had said. Emi and her friends thought that he was responsible for the chaos going on in the game. And were shocked to realize the fact, he was only trying to save everyone.

They only came out of it after the gong rang to announce the start of the voting.

**10 Pandacake:** Vote 15.

In complete silence, everyone followed her command. The villagers lynched the werewolf berserk.
