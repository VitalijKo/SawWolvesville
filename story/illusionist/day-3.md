### DAY 3

Overnight, medium revived detective, and wolf summoner revived shadow werewolf. The werewolves, in turn, stumbled into the beast hunter's trap, which sent the shadow werewolf back to the next world.

**10 Pandacake:** Great job, beast hunter!

**13 5w6:** Thanks, 14. My info :2 ≠ 3.

**2 Koame:** Here's a confirmation that I'm RRV. My trap triggered last night.

**10 Pandacake:** Just how could they not kill 13? The double votes of the werewolves and the killer's vote should have outweighed the villagers.

**9 disappointed:** I have no idea. Most likely someone among the killer and instigator's team thought that killing 15 would be good for them and decided to help us out.

**1 zephyte:** So, 9 and 10, are you happy? You've offended a completely innocent man.

**9 disappointed:** THEN WHY DID HE ACT LIKE HE DID IT ALL???

**6 hack3r:** BECAUSE I HATE YOU ALL FOR WHAT HAPPENED!!! FOR WHAT YOU TOOK FROM ME!!! BUT I LOVE THIS GAME!!! IT IS A PART OF MY LIFE!!! AND I AM DOING EVERYTHING IN MY POWER TO SAVE IT!!!

**9 disappointed:** Omg... So everything we planned is completely useless? 3, 7, 10, 13. We're totally screwed.

**1 zephyte:** Wait, what happened?

Two players answered at the same time.

**6 hack3r:** Long story.

**9 disappointed:** It's a very long story. 

**1 zephyte:** Um... All right. What's the plan?

**9 disappointed:** We wanted to analyze his in-game behavior to see how he creates an endless stream of evil players.

**1 zephyte:** I see. So you and those four players you named came together for this purpose?

**9 disappointed:** Yes, but only me and 10 were part of the plan. The others were needed for two things.

**1 zephyte:** For what?

**9 disappointed:** First, to prolong our communication with him as long as possible. If there were only two of us and we died, we wouldn't be able to communicate with him. And if there are five of us, the chance of all of us dying is low. We could always communicate with him and analyze him.

**1 zephyte:** But how do you negotiate what to ask him?

**9 disappointed:** Parallel to the game, we communicate in an Instagram group chat. There we discuss his behavior and try to understand what's on his mind.

**1 zephyte:** Very thoughtful... And what's the second thing?

**9 zephyte:** Defeat him.

**1 zephyte:** Defeat?

**9 disappointed:** Exactly. Defeat him in this game.

**1 zephyte:** But how?

**9 disappointed:** For the instigator's team.

**10 Pandacake:** 9, are you sure you should be telling this? What if they're in collusion?

**1 zephyte:** I'm not in any collusion. I just happened to be in this game with you by accident. Besides, as you must have realized youself, hacker had nothing to do with what was going on. So I can find out what you wanted to do against him.

**9 disappointed:** See, 10? We were wrong. I guess we can tell her how we wanted to win.

**10 Pandacake:** Okay, tell her. Let her know our plan before the inevitable end of this game. And about the hacker's past, let her ask him herself. I'm sure they've followed each other on Instagram or something.

**1 zephyte:** I'll definitely ask! So how did you want to win it for instigator?

**9 disappointed:** We spent all our gold on improving certain mascots and took away most of the most important roles. Instigator was also one of them. So the recruits would be strong. And the rest of us would help them win. On Instagram, we discussed not only his behavior, but also the state of the game. After each change, we would predict hacker's possible actions and come up with the best strategy to win. But we weren't supposed to just kill him. We had to prolong the game as long as possible, staying alive with him. And once we figured out what he was doing, we would defeat him.

**1 zephyte:** How cool! So this game is completely under your control?

**9 disappointed:** You could say that.

**10 Pandacake:** All right, enough dialog. Let's get back to the game and finish it already.

**9 disappointed:** Sure, where were we? What was the detective's information?

**10 Pandacake:** 2 ≠ 3.

**9 disappointed:** 3 is a confirmed gunner who couldn't have been turned at anyone, so that's 2.

**2 Koame:** I don't understand how this is possible. I'm beast hunter, and this night my trap killed a revived werewolf!

**9 disappointed:** It turns out you're lying.

Voting time came and all the villagers chose 2.

**2 Koame:** WHAT ARE YOU DOING??? I HELPED YOU!!! AND YOU'RE DOING THIS TO ME!!!

**9 disappointed:** There's no way you can explain why you're not in the same team as 3 except that your role isn't what you say it is.

**2 Koame:** ILLUSIONIST!!! LOOK AT THE ROLE LIST!!! ILLUSIONIST IN THE GAME!!!

**9 disappointed:** There's no point in lying. No one will want to hear your excuses. The chance that you were disguised is too low. It's better to face your death with courage and say your last words.

**2 Koame:** Screw you all.

**9 disappointed:** You're done.

The villagers lynched 2. And found out she *wasn't* lying.
