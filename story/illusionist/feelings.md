**I... Guess.. It...**

**Will make me feel better to live,**

**If again, without you I will be.**

**But, how would I forget everything,**

**If last night again was not able to sleep?**

<br>

**As if your favorite heart-to-heart talk,**

**And I changed all the chords to min&oacute;r.**

**Yes, you wanna play with a love,**


**But come on without me now.**

<br>

**The night smolders again,**

**And I'm again without you.**

**I'm alone again, alone until afternoon.**

**I've tried to change myself many times.**

**But something's not right...**

<br>

**Again we are drowning in feeling of love.**

**Oh, I didn't mean to, but gave you a hurt.**

**It's not that hard, just remember one thing:**

**Looking in your eyes, I feel myself free.**
