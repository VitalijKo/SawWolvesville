### DAY 4

As expected, the werewolves killed the detective again, because no one could protect him.

**9 disappointed:** Why didn't we believe her... It's not like no one else claimed RRV. And the illusionist didn't kill anyone, so all the RRVs in the game are alive.

**3 check_me:** Well, 10? You're just like me. And you can't tell others what they did wrong.

**10 Pandacake:** 3 9, you don't have to act out the scene. You know it's part of the plan.

**6 hack3r:** Aren't you afraid you'll just get banned for it? Like 9 said himself, the punishments have gotten stricter.

**9 disappointed:** I lied about updating the punishment system. The situation hasn't changed in any way. Developers and Guardians are drowning in reports and can't come up with a solution.

**6 hack3r:** Well, actually, I already knew that. I'm a member of this game's Discord server, and I didn't see any posts like that. I just wanted to mess with you a little bit.

**9 disappointed:** What's the point? Soon this game will cease to exist and we'll never see each other again.

**6 hack3r:** Goodbye mockery.

**9 disappointed:** I wish *executioner* was here. I wish he was in our last game as well. But he's been offline for about a week now.

**6 hack3r:** Who's that?

**9 disappointed:** He's our friend, who 1 apparently replaced with you.

**6 hack3r:** Executioner is his nickname?

**9 disappointed:** executioner. All letters are lowercase.

**1 zephyte:** He's not as crazy as 6. When I met him, I realized he was better suited for me.

**9 disappointed:** It's easy for you to change the people you love 1.

**1 zephyte:** You've seen for yourself that we played with him less and less often.

**9 disappointed:** Okay, let's move on. I can't figure out... Is hacker a friend of yours?

**6 hack3r:** And you're her friend?

**9 disappointed:** I've been friends with her for a long time.

**6 hack3r:** On this account, I became friends with her about a month ago.

**9 disappointed:** But why didn't you tell me about him and we didn't play, 1? Usually you invite players you like.

**1 zephyte:** I wanted to, but you almost didn't play yourself because you were trying to figure out what was going on with your friends.

**9 disappointed:** Yeah. You're right.

**1 zephyte:** A lot of negative energy coming from you. I should block you on Instagram for a while. Give you time to learn how to be polite to your friends.

**9 disappointed:** I'm sorry. I really didn't mean to hurt you. I've lost my last hope of saving the game and I'm in no mood for it.

**1 zephyte:** It's okay, I understand.

**9 disappointed:** I hope we can find something to play when there's nothing left of this game and continue to communicate.

**1 zephyte:** What are you talking about? Of course we'll remain friends without this game. And we'll definitely find another one.

**9 disappointed:** I'm very glad to hear that. But are you sure about it? You've been playing it since childhood.

**1 zephyte:** It's gonna be sad. That's for sure. But I don't think it's going to interrupt our friendship.

That's when Emi stepped in.

**10 Pandacake:** I can say one thing: it's an amazing story... And we'll definitely talk about it. But right now, we don't have time. And if you're done, I suggest we get back to the game.

**9 disappointed:** Yes, of course.

**1 zephyte:** Okay, back to the game!

**10 Pandacake:** Illusionist, could you kill everyone you disguised?

The girl didn't realize those were her last words.

***The illusionist killed 10 Pandacake.***

***The illusionist killed 14 bunny.***

***The illusionist killed 16 Whyte_.***

**1 zephyte:** What do you think, 10?

**6 hack3r:** Her wish came true. I think she's happy about that.

On that note, the last second of discussion has passed and voting has begun.

**3 check_me:** So which one of you is the real RRV and which one is the illusionist?

After asking this extremely interesting question, Jakob immediately cast his vote for 6. His friend Sanjit followed him.

**6 hack3r:** What are you doing? I'm RRV. Don't you remember, I claimed on the first day?

Vitaly voted Jakob. So did zephyte.

**1 zephyte:** Who are you trying to push, you pathetic illusionist?

**9 disappointed:** Let's put things into words. One of you is the illusionist and the other one is defending him. Me and 3 are the instigator's recruits.

**1 zephyte:** You'll be opening your mouth at the dentist, 9.

**9 disappointed:** Dumb lovebirds.

The vote ended in a tie, and no one was executed.
