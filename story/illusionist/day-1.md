### DAY 1

At night, the werewolves killed player number 4, gambler.

**13 5w6:** 8 ≠ 11.

**1 zephyte:** HIIIIIIIIII 6!!!

**6 hack3r:** Hiiiii. Are you really here too?

**1 zephyte:** How could I miss all this?

**6 hack3r:** Well yeah, your character actually matches this insanity. It was silly to think you wouldn't play.

**1 zephyte:** Definitely. And it's so good to have you here too. It's been a long time since I've seen you, and you haven't texted me. I wanted to play with you, but everything going on didn't give me that opportunity. I thought you left this game on your own.

**6 hack3r:** Me? Are you serious? You don't think I'm crazier than you?

**10 Pandacake:** For real, 1? He's the one who did it!

**6 hack3r:** Quiet, 10. Yes, I'm a hacker, but not that much. And don't stop me from talking to 10. After all, she's the only one in this pathetic lobby I can admire!

**1 zephyte:** Thank you for saying that!

**10 Pandacake:** I don't think 1, you're not crazy, you're just dumb. 

**6 hack3r:** 10... How can you treat a beautiful girl like 1? We don't need your jealousy.

**1 zephyte:** I'm actually already married to him, 10. And I don't care what anyone else says about him.

**10 Pandacake:** What..?

**6 hack3r:** Get over it, 10. I know it's hard, because it's never gonna happen to you. You've been dumped by everyone you've ever met, haven't you?

**10 Pandacake:** ME??? YOU'RE THE ONE WHO ONLY EXISTS IN YOUR OWN DAMN VIRTUAL WORLD, AND CONFESSES YOUR LOVE IN PIXELS!!!

**6 hack3r:** 1 is the sweetest person I've ever met, and with her I don't think about anyone else. She gives me the will to live, and makes me want to keep playing this pathetic game. I adore you, 1.

**1 zephyte:** And I love you so much, 6!

**6 hack3r:** And 10 has never had that, and I would suggest she shut her mouth. People like you won't spoil our love.

**10 Pandacake:** I could ban you forever and I would never get bored.

**1 zephyte:** WHAT??? So 10 is a Guardian?

**6 hack3r:** Absolutely right!

**1 zephyte:** Damn... Now I'm scared...

**10 Pandacake:** For who? For myself, or for that idiot?

**1 zephyte:** For us!

**6 hack3r:** Don't worry, 1. I won't let you get hurt. That's the way it's always been. I've killed everyone who's ever mistreated you.

**1 zephyte:** Yeah, I remember that! I'm not afraid now! I'm not afraid of anything with you!

**6 hack3r:** And rightly so. She can't do anything about it now because she has no reason to ban our accounts. She's just feeling sad that she's never had such a strong mutual love. So let her talk her nonsense. Let's ignore her, my favorite.

**1 zephyte:** I love you more than anything in the world, 6.

**6 hack3r:** And I love you no less. With you by my side, I don't care about any of my problems. None of them can diminish my joy in knowing that you are mine.

**10 Pandacake:** Somebody shoot this idiot.

**6 hack3r:** No need to lose control, 10. You realize you can't do that. If you shoot me, you have no chance of saving the game.

**1 zephyte:** You will forever remain in my heart even after your death!

**6 hack3r:** Dear 1, there's no need to be so dramatic! It's just a game! Yes, they may shoot me in this game, but we'll definitely see each other in another one!

**1 zephyte:** You're right, 6, I'm sorry. It's just that I'm very attached to you.

**6 hack3r:** I understand, 1. And you can express it however you want. Because I feel the same way about you.

**1 zephyte:** You're so sweet.

**10 Pandacake:** You know what? If you love her so much, go up to her and give her a hug!

**6 hack3r:** What are you trying to achieve by doing that?

Ignoring his question, Emi continued.

**10 Pandacake:** What? You can't? Yeah. You can only imagine the feeling in your mind, knowing you'll never get it. So go back to crying into your pillow like you do every night!

**6 hack3r:** Dumb slut...

 **10 Pandacake:** And we'll get back to the game. The detective gave us the information: 8 ≠ 11. Both say your role.

**5 RedMyst:** I'm pacifist.

**8 cottonclouds:** Pacifist.

**10 Pandacake:** Oh, good. We can't figure out who's lying, so I suggest you reveal each other.

**3 check_me:** No, there's no need to reveal. 5 said the role first, so it's clear it's 8.

**10 Pandacake:** Jakob, it's not always like that.

**3 check_me:** That's right, I'm gonna kill him now.

**8 cottonclouds:** No, wait! There's a voting coming up and I'll reveal him!

The remaining seconds expired, and the voting phase began. Now the shooter could shoot, and the pacifist could reveal roles.

**3 check_me:** Game over, you pathetic liar!

And Jakob fired. 8, who was the pacifist, died.

But just a millisecond before his death, he revealed the role of 11, who turned out to be the fool.

**10 Pandacake:** WHAT DID YOU DO, IDIOT??? WHY DIDN'T YOU WAIT???

**3 check_me:** Damn! Sorry! I was sure he was a werewolf because 11 declared his role first, and besides, his message itself was longer.

**10 Pandacake:** You have a high enough level to have been in games where the evil roles managed to claim a good role earlier!

**3 check_me:** But that's a rare occurrence. I was hoping it wasn't now!

**10 Pandacake:** What's the logic now, if they were claiming pacifists, and you could just let them reveal each other's roles?

**3 check_me:** There could have been a dangerous werewolf in the game that in all this confusion could have activated their ability!

**10 Pandacake:** You don't realize at all how low the chance of what you're talking about is. There's a random werewolf in the game, but even if he had an ability that fits your reasoning, it's more likely he would have activated it after the claims! And at most before the voting, because they knew there was a gunner in the game!

**3 check_me:** But we don't know if that was actually the case, so it was better not to risk it!

**1 zephyte:** 6, look how brainless they are! It's funny to watch!

**6 hack3r:** Totally agree. They are too dumb for this game. And I always knew it.

**10 Pandacake:** Are you the smartest one here? What's your own role?

**1 zephyte:** Come on, sweetie, tell them your role so they realize their silliness is no one's fault.

**6 hack3r:** I have no problem saying my role. I'm RRV. I can tell you the exact role if you want. Only it might be somewhat important, and if I name it, it might not cause the best consequences.

**10 Pandacake:** That's not necessary. No one claimed RRV, so you could either be telling the truth or lying. I suggest other RRVs declare themselves so we can see if he's not real.

**1 zephyte:** 6 is the most real RRV! You 10, on the other hand, have no role. And you're way too social for that. I think we all wouldn't mind knowing *your* role.
