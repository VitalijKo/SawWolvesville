### DAY 5

On the fifth night, no one had fallen victim to the werewolves.

**6 hack3r:** Well, you could have won.

The friends didn't say anything. Apparently, they were shocked to realize their mistake had cost them their lives.

**6 hack3r:** 3 9.

**6 hack3r:** You really could have won. If you hadn't tried to kill me. That was your mistake. From my behavior with 1, you thought she was the illusionist. But she's not. I'm the illusionist. I'm the killer. As always, in all our games.

**3 check_me:** No... No...

**6 hack3r:** I know it's hard, but get over it.

**3 check_me:** 1, why haven't you claimed RRV in the entire game?

**1 zephyte:** I knew he was an illusionist. But he didn't stand a chance against the instigator team. So I decided to help him out by pretending I was the illusionist and voting you.

**3 check_me:** Are you... Are you that dumb? You screwed us all up!

**1 zephyte:** Did I need you to win?

**3 check_me:** Get lost, you dumb female.

**6 hack3r:** Now you feel helpless, 3 9. You no longer have a choice to live or die. But I'm giving you another choice.

**3 check_me:** What is it?

**6 hack3r:** *To scream or not to scream*.

Vitaly closed his eyes, trying to visualize the desperation of the two players. Then, as if apologizing, he said:

**6 hack3r:** Game over.

The last thing they heard was a click.

***The illusionist killed 3 check_me.***

***9 disappointed (Wolf seer) fled the village after the second recruit died.***

**6 hack3r:** Well, here we are all alone, dear *Gokce*.

**1 zephyte:** Congratulations! I knew you would beat all those idiots! I love you!

**6 hack3r:** Really?

**1 zephyte:** Yeah! Why do you ask?

Vitaly smiled ominously.

**6 hack3r:** Why do you think I'm using a different account?

**1 zephyte:** You asked me to add myself here so Sanjit wouldn't recognize you as Vitaly.

**6 hack3r:** Why did I ask you to do that?

**1 zephyte:** I thought you wanted to play a joke on him. Kill him for being a solo killer and win. And then just before the end, tell him you're *executioner*.

**6 hack3r:** You see, that's only half true.

**1 zephyte:** Then what was the real reason?

**6 hack3r:** That's what I'm going to tell you all now. Listen carefully. This is the story of my revenge that started *one month ago*.

**...**

**6 hack3r:** I hated 13 for mercilessly breaking my heart. I hated 10 for forever banning me. And I hated 3 and 9 for always trying to stop me. If it weren't for all of them, everything would be fine. They were always interfering with my plans. They felt it was their RESPONSIBILITY to stop me from showing everyone that they underestimated me. And all the *two* times I've found love, they've been right there, ready to destroy everything I have.

**6 hack3r:** Now I'm destroying the most precious thing to them. This game. And I'm very happy that my revenge is complete.

**6 hack3r:** But they weren't the main target of all this. They became targets on their own, just like all the other players. My main target was *you*.

**1 zephyte:** Me?

**6 hack3r:** You and I played and communicated very well. And I enjoyed it. Until you invited Sanjit.

**1 zephyte:** 9?

**6 hack3r:** It was a real miracle I found you. If I hadn't joined a clan with the same icon as yours back then, you wouldn't have added me as a friend and our relationship wouldn't have started. In our best games, I thought back to that. I couldn't believe that we had found each other. I was happy.

A tear streamed from his left eye.

**6 hack3r:** It went on like that for a long time. But then you introduced me to your new friend. Which was him. My worst enemy. My worst enemy turned out to be your friend.

**6 hack3r:** Since I was under a new account, he didn't recognize me. Yes, I stayed insane because it's a character trait I can't hide. But you were the same way. So there was no suspicion on his part about my identity. After all, I'm not the only insane player in the damn game, am I?

**6 hack3r:** I tried not to give any sign and act like a new friend to him. We had good conversations and played together. And every day I learned something new about you two.

**6 hack3r:** You found each other in the game. I didn't ask under what circumstances, it wasn't important. What was important was that it happened, and that you became good friends yourselves.

**6 hack3r:** But there was one thing that gave me a great shock.

Tears were now running down all over his face. However, he continued to smile. A wide smile.

**6 hack3r:** Turns out you're friends in real life too. You live in the same town. And you've met a few times.

**6 hack3r:** Can you imagine how I felt? When I realized that the player who gave me back my faith in love was friends with my worst enemy.

**6 hack3r:** You were the only girl in my life who loved me. I would do anything for you. I would always help you with your quests. I would figure out player roles and let you know so you would check them out, or kill them, depending on the assignment. I always helped you win for killers when it was important to you. Without fear of a ban. No fear of the Guardians. I mined gold on all my accounts, bought roses, sent them to my main account, spun the rose wheel, got gold, then bought roses again, and gave them to you. I didn't feel sorry for them, because I knew you needed them more.

**6 hack3r:** You gave me such motivation for my songs...

**6 hack3r:** Do you want me to send you the lyrics of my favorite?

**...**

<br>

**Girl, I ain't exhaling, because I'm maxed out,**

**But missing you so much when you're not around.**

**We made a pinky swear that we'd never part,**

**Even though I knew that we'd really hurt.**

<br>

**New day is coming with new date, I can't even make my bed:**

**Thousand tasks every day, but for me you are the main.**

**Gave you everything I had... Just because I NEED!**

**I want my love... Coming back TO ME!**

<br>

**I exhale the pain and your perfume,**

**There is no way to save me and you.**

**I exhale the pain and the cold inside,**

**Set me on fire, SET ON FIRE!**

<br>

**I exhale the pain and your perfume,**

**There is no way to save me and you.**

**I exhale the pain and the cold inside,**

**Set me on fire, SET ON FIRE!**

<br>

**Let you feel the cold by holding my hands,**

**I embrace you and don't care about players.**

**You take my outfits, and they totally dont matter,**

**All these stuff I have are suiting you better.**

<br>

**Your laughter's on my ringtone, knocking at the do-or.**

**Talking 'bout feelings, you're blushing like a ne-on.**

**Gave you everything I had... Just because I NEED!**

**I want my love... Coming back TO ME!**

<br>

**I exhale the pain and your perfume,**

**There is no way to save me and you.**

**I exhale the pain and the cold inside,**

**Set me on fire, SET ON FIRE!**

<br>

**I exhale the pain and your perfume,**

**There is no way to save me and you.**

**I exhale the pain and the cold inside,**

**Set me on fire, SET ON FIRE!**

<br>

**...**

**1 zephyte:** Omg...

**6 hack3r:** I loved you, but this happened. And then I decided to get revenge on all of you.

**6 hack3r:** I created a whole farm of game-ruining bots. They automatically log into the game and break a whole bunch of rules. They send insulting messages, spam, flood, use their abilities randomly, give false information, pretend to be members of the other team, scam for roses. And flee when they need to.

**6 hack3r:** You said you came up with a plan to stop me. But you couldn't do it. What's more, you led me to believe it wasn't me. Believed that I wanted to help this worthless game. While I wish for its end more than anything else in the world.

**6 hack3r:** You said you planned this game. But I planned it. I planned the whole thing. Just like in the good old days. Remember?

**6 hack3r:** You said you had two goals in this game: stop me and defeat me. Well, you failed on all counts, and you failed miserably.

**6 hack3r:** It is not enough for me to simply defeat you, Gokce, for that will not save me from pain. Nothing will. But I can wipe out what we had in common. If this game disappears, so do we.

**6 hack3r:** Everyone who is watching this game right now, prepare to be defeated. And you, 1, prepare for your death.

**6 hack3r:** How do you want to die? By lynching, or by disguise?

The gong sounded. Without a second's hesitation, the former friends voted each other.

**1 zephyte:** Look what your useless jealousy has done to you, Vitaly.

**6 hack3r:** DO YOU EVEN REALIZE WHO YOU'RE CALLING JEALOUS??? SOMEONE WHO'S NEVER HAD THE SLIGHTEST ATTENTION!!! WHO NO ONE HAS EVER NOTICED!!! WHO DIDN'T KNOW WHAT FRIENDSHIP IS!!! WHO DIDN'T KNOW WHAT LOVE IS!!!

**1 zephyte:** You think this is my fault? How was I supposed to know that the friend I found was your enemy? And what does it even matter to you? Yes, he was my friend, but I loved you. As much as you loved me. You could have told me about it, and we could have decided what to do.

**6 hack3r:** I TOLD YOU WE SHOULDN'T HAVE SECRETS!!! WHO BROKE THAT RULE???

**1 zephyte:** Is that really the only reason you're willing to go along with this?

**6 hack3r:** NOTHING ELSE KEPT ME HERE!!! DON'T YOU GET IT??? THIS IS THE ONLY PLACE WHERE I GET ATTENTION!!! WHERE I CAN BE LOVED!!!

**6 hack3r:** BUT SOMEONE ALWAYS MESSES THINGS UP!!! THERE'S BOUND TO BE SOME DUMB IDIOTS WHO WANT TO TAKE IT AWAY FROM ME!!!

**6 hack3r:** I'M SICK OF IT!!! SO I'M CHANGING MY PRINCIPLE TO THIS: IF I DON'T GET MINE, NO ONE WILL!!!

**6 hack3r:** GAME OVER!!!

**6 hack3r:** AND NOW ANSWER ME THIS QUESTION: HOW DO YOU WANT TO DIE???

**1 zephyte:** Vitaly, can I ask you to do something before my execution?

**6 hack3r:** Sure.

**1 zephyte:** Are you able to check the status of your bots right now?

**6 hack3r:** Yes, I can.

**1 zephyte:** Do it, please.

**6 hack3r:** Right away.

**6 hack3r:** It's impossible... Everything is broken... There are nothing but errors in the consoles... Bots are shutting down one by one... But why...

**1 zephyte:** Restart the game.

Vitaly did as she said. Not believing what he saw, he refreshed the game page on his computer as well.

**6 hack3r:** Everything is in *Turkish*? But that's not enough...

**1 zephyte:** Open the source code of the page.

*F12.*

**6 hack3r:** I did... But there's nothing wrong with it...

**1 zephyte:** Take a closer look.

A couple of seconds, and Vitaly understood everything.

*10...* 

**6 hack3r:** Everything here is wrapped in additional divs...

*9...*

**1 zephyte:** Changing the language made text detection useless. And the extra tags made all the locators wrong. Your bots broke because they referenced non-existent elements.

*8...*

**6 hack3r:** But how do you know all this?

*7...*

*1 zephyte:* Sanjit texted me on Instagram asking me to tell you whatever he says.

*6...*

**1 zephyte:** On the fourth day, they realized that you weren't spreading the idea of spoiling the game, but were using bots. They came to this conclusion by analyzing your character and understanding your most likely activity.

*5...*

**1 zephyte:** They reported this clue to the game developers, who, thanks to it, decided to look at the information of all bad players for patterns. And they noticed that the bot-like accounts were controlled from the same IP address. The same one that controlled yours.

*4...*

**1 zephyte:** All of those accounts, except the one you're running from now, got their bans. By Emi. And she's ready to ban you at the end of this game.

*3...*

**1 zephyte:** I loved you, Vitaly. And as much as I hate to say it...

*2...*

***Player 1 zephyte is the mayor!***

*1...*

**1 zephyte:** GAME OVER.

***The villager killed 6 hack3r (Illusionist).***

**The villagers won.**
