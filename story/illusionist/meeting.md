**9 disappointed**: *X*.

**10 Pandacake:** *X*.

**6 hack3r:** Many people really wouldn't notice anything. But I would advise you to use something more casual. For example, the greeting. "Hello, 10!" "Hello, 9!"

**9 disappointed:** Is that all you had to say?

**6 hack3r:** Do you want to play with me one last time? Amidst the ruins of this game, while its wreckage falls upon us...

**10 Pandacake:** Only your idea will fall into ruin. You're just a loser who will never succeed.

**6 hack3r:** Right now, you're in absolutely no position to be saying those words to me.

**6 hack3r:** I remember when you banned me for *unacceptable behavior* for 3 months.

**6 hack3r:** *Guardian #27*. 

**10 Pandacake:** I made a deal with the other guardians to take you in case you were reported, reasoning that you were good at disguising infractions and could manipulate the guardians. No one would give you such a long ban. After all, guardians are just as human as the rest of us. You'd trick them. But I know you, so your manipulations don't work on me.

**6 hack3r:** Too bad it was useless. These idiots won't accomplish anything with their pathetic bans.

**9 disappointed:** That's why we're here. 

**6 hack3r:** What's more? I thought you wanted one last goodbye game.

**9 disappointed:** We want to show that you've always lost and you will lose now. No matter what you do in this game, you're still the loser. You can think of all kinds of ways to cheat, but your killing roles win count will never exceed 5.

**6 hack3r:** Nice try to provoke me, if we all didn't know better. I have a lot of wins for killing roles.

**6 hack3r:** About me losing to you, I was just unlucky. I was thinking every detail of those games. Everything was going the way I had planned, except for one thing I didn't take into account, which made it all screwed up.

**9 disappointed:** You think anything's gonna change in this game?

**6 hack3r:** You're not gonna make me doubt myself. I've had enough of that in real life.

**9 disappointed:** I don't. But are you sure that this time everything will go exactly as you planned, despite the new method?

**6 hack3r:** I'll deal with you like you're pathetic kittens.

**6 hack3r:** Oh... 13, and you're with them?

**13 5w6:** What did you think?

**6 hack3r:** It's not my fault, it's your fault it turned out that way. But that's okay, I'm not offended anymore. I'll destroy you, and after that I'll never see you again.

During the entire dialog, players were joining and leaving. They read the new messages, realized what was in store for them, and left the room. Eventually, the required number of players was reached and the timer started counting down.
