**...**

**disappointed:** It's incredible. This was all part of his plan? To find you and play a new game to prove he's smarter than you?

**life:** It seems so. I can't believe it myself. I was amazed when I found out he was the player I met one year ago.

**check_me:** He's been studying you for so long. He's known you almost as long as I have... 

**life:** That's right.

**life:** You know, when we first met, others called him Loki for some reason. And it felt very familiar to me, but I couldn't figure out why. I just forgot about the events of the past and didn't recognize him. I didn't put the picture together.

**dissapointed:** It happens. You have enough problems and tasks, you get caught up in them and gradually forget about everything.

**check_me:** And he was only 16 years old. Or even 15. And he was already so obsessed with it. Moreover, he was doing great. Do you think he's a genius?

**life:** It's probably just a matter of a little calculating and getting the roles right for his game. He couldn't be guaranteed of anything. While the probabilities of some events can be calculated, nothing will ever happen 100%. I'm sure there were some of his games where his plans failed.

**dissapointed:** Could it really be what you were saying? Lack of attention, low self-esteem, loneliness?

**life:** It's true. I'm a pretty good character reader, and in this case, I can clearly see those signs.

**check_me:** Did you figure out the number 47 that you said him one month ago?

**life:** Oh, yeah. I thought about it, and I finally came up with a solution. It was actually the outcome of the game, although it's far from certain.

**life:** It's the sum of the numbers in the alphabet of the first letters of our names and our roles with our numbers.

**life:** E (5) + l (12) + E (5) + D (4) + 8 + 13 = 47.

**disappointed:** Unthinkable...

**check_me:** Everything is unthinkable in this situation, Sanjit. Everything.

**life:** So, like he said, he's thought out the outcome of this game even with something he couldn't influence: the number I'll choose.

**check_me:** But it turns out if you didn't pick a big enough number, the plan would have failed.

**life:** He psychologically forced me to pick a big number. Said it was better to pick a two-digit number that didn't include the same digits for more interest.

**check_me:** Well, that makes sense.

**disappointed:** He unsubscribed from us on Instagram and unfriended in the game... Do you think he'll be back?

**life:** He was very emotional at the end of that game. It had a special meaning to him. I can definitely tell he's very angry at me, but I think that anger is going to destroy him now. He can't stand the fact that after all this time he couldn't avenge me.

**life:** It will have a big impact on his self-esteem and make him rethink how he views himself and what he does. But it's impossible to say exactly what will change after that. He can either stop his work, or, on the contrary, continue it with even more effort, and turn it into something larger.

**life:** One way or another, if he can't overcome his feelings, one day, when we've completely forgotten him, he'll come back...
