### DAY 1

Life looked at the players on the game field. And decided to pick numbers 10 and 12. The teams of these players matched.

About halfway through, player number 15 fleed from the village. He probably didn't want to play the role he had been given.

When the night was over, the werewolves killed player number 14. The evil detective who was also in the game killed 9. But the roles of these players were hidden.

The girl opened the list of roles and realized that it was what she thought: there was a confusion werewolf in the game.

During the day discussion, everyone who had any information shared it.

**13 life:** I'm the detective. 10 = 12.

Player number 2 claimed a villager.

**2 TSwizzle:** I'm claiming a forkman day one. Please don't kill me!

The red lady said about visiting player number 11, so he was not a werewolf or a killer.

**12 Koame:** I'm the red lady. 11 is good.

The sheriff said he didn't get any information as he was observing other players.

**16 check_me:** Sheriff here. No information for today.

Teams of 10 and 12 were equal, and therefore player 10 belonged to the villagers team.

There were no problems with the roles so far, and the chat went quiet. At that moment, Vitaly sent a very mysterious message addressed to Life, and it gave her a very familiar feeling.

**8 EvilDetective:** 13. I want to play a game with you. The rules are simple. I'm giving you one chance to win. To do that, all you have to do is check me.

The girl tried to remember where she could have seen something like this, but nothing came to mind.

**13 life:** Are you saying that if I check you, I'll win? Then what's the point of this game if you're telling me a way to win?

**8 EvilDetective:** The point is, you only get one shot at it. If you don't use it, you'll try desperately to change things later on, but you won't be able to, because everything will go the way it was planned from the beginning.

**13 life:** Sorry, SweetDetective, but you think a lot of yourself. 

**8 EvilDetective:** Remember the number I asked you to pick one month ago?

**16 check_me:** What number?

**13 life:** One month ago, for some reason, he asked me to think of any number between 1 and 100. I named 47.

**16 check_me:** Why, 8?

**8 EvilDetective:** That number is the outcome of this game.

**16 check_me:** What do you mean?

**8 EvilDetective:** Literally. At the end of this game, you will see that those who knew this number knew the end of the game.

**16 check_me:** Very interesting to see that.

At this point the dialog ended. Suddenly one player heroically replaced the fleed 15.

It was their friend Sanjit.

**13 life:** 15!!! IT'S YOU!!!

**16 check:** OMG... What are the odds of this...

**15 disappointed:** Hi all!

**15 disappointed:** 8, 13, 16... Here you all are...

**8 EvilDetective:** Hi! Yeah, amazing coincidence.

**8 EvilDetective:** Just not for me.

The gong has sounded. The voting has begun.

**8 EvilDetective:** And now, 13, it's time for us to say goodbye. Because you're a fake detective.

**13 life:** How am I fake?

**8 EvilDetective:** Like that. I'm the real detective. And my information is 12 â‰  13. 

**13 life:** Too late, Vit. You took too long to come up with that lie. You should have tried sooner.

**8 EvilDetective:** I just wanted to watch you and see how happy you were that you succeeded. Probably after about 20 seconds you thought one of the dead was a detective. And no one would stop you from carrying out your plan the next day to write information about inequality and win as a headhunter.

**13 life:** You're not making any sense! I'M THE REAL DETECTIVE!!!

**8 EvilDetective:** Villagers, let's vote 13. We all realize she's just a headhunter. She's just a pathetic SweetHunter.

**13 life:** You're such a...

**8 EvilDetective:** Smart? I sure am. I've been waiting for this to happen so I could figure you out. Goodbye, headhunter.

*10...*

One by one, gradually the villagers began to vote for lynching 13. They believed 8. Sanjit alone did not.

*7...*

**8 EvilDetective:** Come on 15, stop them from making that mistake.

This message was sent by Vitaly a second before Sanjit's message.

*6...*

**15 disappointed:** WAIT. WHY ARE YOU SO THOUGHTLESS? WHAT IF 8 IS THE HEADHUNTER? IF WE KILL 13, WE LOSE. PLEASE STOP!

*5...*

**15 disappointed:** VIGILANTE, REVEAL THE ROLE OF ONE OF THEM!!!

*4...*

**8 EvilDetective:** EXACTLY THAT!!! PREFERABLY MINE!!! LOOK I'M ACTUALLY THE DETECTIVE!!!

*3...*

In the final seconds, the vigilante revealed 13's role. She turned out to be the real detective.

*2...*

Very quickly, everyone took their votes away from 13 and started voting for 8.

*1...*

But there was too little time left. He didn't get enough votes and wasn't executed by the villagers.

And at the very end, the red lady sent a message with the numbers of two players, one of whom she was going to visit.

**12 Koame:** I'LL VISIT 1/8.
