## PRESENT

<br>

It's been a month since Life first met a player named EvilDetective, whose name was Vitaly. During that time, they had been chatting a lot, and so they had learned a number of things about each other. They often spent time playing together, and it looked like they actually enjoyed it as much as they enjoyed coomunicating.

Today was a day off. Life didn't need to go anywhere. She didn't have any important errands to run either, so she decided to play Wolvesville as she usually did in her free time. The girl picked up her phone and opened the game. Looking at her friends list, she saw that everyone was online: Vitaly, Sanjit, and Jakob. Life was glad that she would be able to play with them all. She immediately clicked on *"Play"* and selected the *"Play with friends"* option. After that, she invited all three of them and waited.

Just ten seconds later, Vitaly joined the game.

***EvilDetective joined.***

And after about the same amount of time, Jakob joined.

***3 check_me joined.***

**EvilDetective:** Hi!!!

**check_me:** Hi!

The friends said hello to each other and chatted a bit.

**check_me:** Are we waiting for someone?

**life:** I invited Sanjit, but for some reason he's not joiining, even though he's online.

**EvilDetective:** Probably busy and just left the game running.

**life:** Looks like it. Well, then I'll start it.

And she started the game.

The room was filling up very quickly. That and the fact that the friends had different internet speeds affected the fact that they weren't weren'tnext to each other. Life got the number 13.

There was almost no waiting. The game began. The wheel of roles rolled in front of the girl's eyes and stopped on one...

She got the role of **Detective**.
