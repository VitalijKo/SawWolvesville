**EvilDetective:** Hi life.

**life:** Hi Vit!

**EvilDetective:** I want to ask you something. Tell me any number between 1 and 100. And just to make it more interesting, choose something difficult. Preferably, let's say, a two-digit number that doesn't involve the same digits.

**life:** Okay... Let me think.

**life:** 47.

**EvilDetective:** Thank you.

**life:** Why do you need it?

**EvilDetective:** I want to show you that I can set things up any way I want, even with things I couldn't possibly know.

**life:** I'm not sure what you're talking about.

**EvilDetective:** You will understand soon. Just remember that number, because one day it could change everything.
