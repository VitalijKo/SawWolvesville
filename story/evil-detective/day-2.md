### DAY 2

During the night, the werewolves didn't kill anyone. As so often happens, they may have encountered a defense. The evil detective killed 10. He turned out to be a doctor. But it was the red lady who died, by visiting an evil player.

**13 life:** 3 â‰  8.

**16 check_me:** No information for today...

**3 Blau:** Im cursed, unturned.

**5 Eflora:** How can you be unturned if no one was killed tonight?

**3 Blau:** You know, there could be several reasons for that! The wolves could have attacked someone who was protected. Or found a killer!

**5 Eflora:** Too unlikely.

**3 Blau:** Not enough to be untrue.

**16 check_me:** I think 3 is worth believing. There is actually a not insignificant chance that she hasn't been turned.

**8 EvilDetective:** Totally agree.

**8 EvilDetective:** 5, engage your brain. When 10 died, his role was not hidden. Why do you think that is? WHY???

**8 EvilDetective:** Because the wolves thought that the role of the player they wanted to kill DIDN'T NEED TO BE REVEALED!!!

**5 Eflora:** You mean they attacked....

**8 EvilDetective:** Me... Yes. Me. They knew that 1 was a wolf. And just in case the red lady visited me, they wanted to kill me. And since everyone knew I was the HEADHUNTER, they didn't want to include the confusion. After all, everyone already knows the role of me and of course 12.

**8 EvilDetective:** But some smart protector activated his ability on me, from which I survived. And the wolves didn't kill anyone. For that, I'm very grateful.

**8 EvilDetective:** So this proves that 3 was not turned into a werewolf.

**13 life:** 8... You're not that silly.

**8 EvilDetective:** Of course. You called me sweet, not silly. Sweet can be smart.

The chat went quiet. Everyone was thinking about what had been said.

**13 check_me:** So, what do we have in the end? 1 is a protector. 3 is an unturned cursed, and 8 is a headhunter.

**5 Eflora:** I'm sorry. But what you said has too low probability. Come back to reality. We're not in a movie.

**5 Eflora:** And I don't believe any of this.

Having said that, player number 5, who turned out to be a vigilante, shot 3. She was actually cursed. Not turned.

**5 Eflora:** That's... This is impossible...

With despair overwhelming her, she fled the village.

**16 check_me:** She didn't have the brains to process such information... 

**8 EvilDetective:** Agreed. She wasn't thinking. Things could have been different if she had just thought. Such is her fate.

At the voting time, everyone chose player number 1. After she was killed by the villagers, her role was revealed. Confusion werewolf.
