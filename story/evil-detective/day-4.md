### DAY 4

During the night, evil detective killed the red lady who was apparently visiting no one. The werewolves didn't kill anyone.

So, eventually there are only four players left alive: 7, 8, 13, 16.

**13 life:** 7 â‰  16. 4 was right... There is another werewolf in the game...

**13 life:** 12, you could have visited me...

**8 EvilDetective:** Confidence in her choices killed her. But self-confidence is only necessary if you actually know what the sequence of events will be.

**16 check_me:** This information will be useless, but okay. 7 or 8 killed 12.

**7 mrholmes:** All this time you've been the evil detective, 8? Just like your nickname?

**8 EvilDetective:** The answer to my riddle is in the number. You won't understand it, 7, but 13 will.

**7 mrholmes:** what the hell is a number, you idiot??? YOU ARE THE EVIL DETECTIVE, AND NOW WE'RE GOING TO KILL YOU!!!

**8 EvilDetective:** 13, WHY DID YOU CHOOSE 47???

**16 check_me:** Okay, enough yelling! Let's just deal with the situation! We're gonna lose either way. The only thing we can decide is who wins: the werewolves or the evil detective.

**13 life:** I'd give the win to the werewolves. I hate it when the killer wins.

**16 check_me:** I don't really care, so I'll follow you. We just need to figure out if evil detective is 7 or 8.

**8 EvilDetective:** Kill me.

**7 mrholmes:** See? He's confessing. Kill him.

**8 EvilDetective:** I'm not gonna lie anymore. I'll tell you one thing: what you want, you can't have.

**7 mrholmes:** What do you mean? They want the werewolves to win, and you are the evil detective!

But the player didn't get an answer to his question.

Gong announced the start of voting, and everyone cast their vote to kill 8.

The next moment there was complete silence. Everyone watched as the timer gradually decreased.

But suddenly Jakob sent the following message.

**16 check_me:** Wait, wait, wait. 13, are you sure you want the werewolves to win?

**13 life:** Absolutely.

**16 check_me:** Well, it may not happen.

**13 life:** Why?

**16 check_me:** What if all this time, 8 was just pretending to be the evil detective? What if he's the wolf seer? What if he knows that 7 is the evil detective and is going to make him win?

**16 check_me:** 8 is actually acting very mysterious, like from the beginning he knew how the game was going to go and how it was going to end. But nowhere was it stated that he would be the one to win.

**13 life:** Damn, you're right...

**7 mrholmes:** RIGHT??? ARE YOU OKAY? HE'S NOT MAKING ANY SENSE. I, AS A WEREWOLF, FULLY CONFIRM THAT 8 IS THE EVIL DETECTIVE!!!

**16 check_me:** Shut your filthy mouth already! Nobody's asking for your opinion right now!

**7 mrholmes:** Brainless idiot...

**16 check_me:** So, what do you think about that, 13? It's not that he promised he'd win, it's that you'd lose.

**13 life:** Indeed, Jak, that makes a lot of sense.

With these words she switched her vote to 7. And then 15 did the same.

**7 mrholmes:** This... This can't be... No... No! NO!!!

No one reacted to his outrage.

**7 mrholmes:** YOU CAN'T DO THIS, YOU GODDAMN BASTARDS!!! EVERYTHING IS GOING EXACTLY ACCORDING TO HIS PLAN!!!

The player screamed desperately, trying to convince Life and Sanjit of their mistake, but in vain.

He died. And everyone saw his role:

**Wolf seer.**
