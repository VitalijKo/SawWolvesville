### DAY 5

On this night, the evil detective killed 16. The last two players left.

**8 EvilDetective:** Well, dear life. Here we are all alone. Just like that one year ago.

**13 life:** Yes, I remember you. The_Loki. It was you.

**8 EvilDetective:** Finally.

**13 life:** Why are you doing all this?

**8 EvilDetective:** I wanted to outplay you. Show you that I'm smarter than you. That I was unlucky that time, and now I've planned everything.

**13 life:** Are you sure you're gonna succeed in this game?

**8 EvilDetective:** Already. I knew the first forger would flee the village before he could make a shield or sword. He would be replaced by someone else. I didn't know it would be Sanjit, but agree, it worked out even more interesting that way.

**8 EvilDetective:** He only had 3 nights to use his abilities. In that amount of, he could only give you one item. So he gave you a shield. He didn't have time to give you the sword. So now you're completely helpless. Like a little kitten wandering through the mud.

**13 life:** I enjoyed playing with you, Vitaly.

**8 EvilDetective:** And me with you, and me with you... **Vivi**...

**13 life:** But then why are you doing this? Why couldn't we have stayed friends? You could forget about what happened in the past and spend your time with us.

**8 EvilDetective:** You don't quite understand me. I enjoyed playing with you, but not in the same way you enjoyed playing with me. I remembered you all along, from the day I first saw you. I thought about you, unable to sleep. I looked for you. I waited for you. Just like I did for your friends. And finally I met you.

**8 EvilDetective:** During our first game, you could have sat quietly and not interrupted me, could have watched it run itself, could have admired my plan. But you made the choice to stop me. I couldn't understand why. So I decided to show you what it means to get in God's way.

**13 life:** You're not God. You're just a power addict. Tell me, I guess your parents didn't pay to you much attention, you didn't have many friends, nobody wanted to hang out with you?

**8 EvilDetective:** YOU DON'T KNOW ME!!! AND YOU HAVE NO WAY OF KNOWING ME!!!

**13 life:** You were suffering from loneliness. And you wanted to show everyone that they made a mistake by not noticing you. But your control over people only makes it worse. You make them afraid of you. Not respect you. Not to love... That's why you were an outcast, and you're still an outcast.

**8 EvilDetective:** SHUT YOUR GODDAMN MOUTH!!! SOON THOSE MEASLY SECONDS WILL PASS, AND YOU'LL DIE, AND I'LL WIN. AND I'LL NEVER SEE YOU ALL AGAIN!!!

**8 EvilDetective:** You'll remember for the rest of your life that you were outplayed!!! AND THAT I'M THE SMARTEST!!!

Of all the dead players, except for those who died on the first night, no one quit. Everyone was looking at the shocking outcome of the game. Most likely, they were in great surprise, not believing their eyes, and discussed the relationship of two, now former, friends. Some of them had tens of thousands of games behind their backs, but no one had ever seen such a game. For them, it would certainly be the most incredible one they would forget forever.

**8 EvilDetective:** NO ONE HELPED YOU!!! NOT JAKOB, NOT EDWARD!!! IT'S JUST ME AND YOU!!! AND YOU'RE FINISHED!!!

**8 EvilDetective:** THIS TIME, GIRL, I'VE CONSIDERED EVERY DETAIL!!! FROM START TO FINISH!!!

**8 EvilDetective:** I'VE BEEN WAITING A LONG TIME FOR THIS MOMENT. ONE MONTH. I'VE BEEN CALCULATING EVERY POSSIBILITY. AND FINALLY, TODAY, THE PERFECT ROLE ROTATION FOR MY GAME HAS ARRIVED.

**8 EvilDetective:** THIS IS THE DAY OF MY RISE, VIVI. AND THE DAY OF YOUR END.

The voting has begun. In a rage, Vitaly immediately chose Life.

**13 life:** We loved you, Vitaly.

**8 EvilDetective:** Loved...

**13 life:** And we can still make it right. I'll help you. I'll help you get rid of all your communication problems. 

**8 EvilDetective:** You don't understand...

**13 life:** I do, Vitaly. And you know it.

**8 EvilDetective:** It's just a little bit more and it's game over...

**13 life:** You think you're in an advantageous position right now. But you're not. And I'm giving you a choice. You can let me vote you out and lynch you. Then we'll be together again. But you can also try to kill me by voting me out.

**13 life:** In that case, it would be over between us.

**13 life:** Please make the right choice.

**8 EvilDetective:** The right choice? What do you mean, *"try to kill"*? Why not just *kill*?

**13 life:** Because you can't do it.

**8 EvilDetective:** What makes you so sure?

**13 life:** You care about me too much.

**8 EvilDetective:** That doesn't make any sense.

**13 life:** What do you have besides your wins where you were God?

**13 life:** What have you experienced when you've calculated the outcome of games for months, and in the end, everything went according to your plan?

**13 life:** Were you happy?

Vitaly was silent, as if analyzing what she had said. Time was running out and he didn't give out any reaction.

**13 life:** I'll make one last suggestion. We can fix everything and be friends like before. There will come a time when your hatred will pass. You will no longer want to continue your work, but you will wish you had us back and you will no longer have friends willing to accept you for who you are and help you.

After a few seconds, he couldn't take it anymore and answered her.

**8 EvilDetective:** Nothing will ever be the way I want it to be. I've been deprived of that. But given a gift. A mind of my own. That allows me to calculate everything, every outcome.

**8 EvilDetective:** But you don't have to be like me to realize you're the loser in this situation.

**13 life:** Okay, then kill me.

**13 life:** But you don't have to be like me to realize: you didn't calculate everything in this game.

*10...*

**8 EvilDetective:** What do you mean?

*9...* 

**13 life:** Why do you think we killed the wolf seer and not you?

*8...*

**8 EvilDetective:** Because you wanted to let the werewolves win and you thought he was an evil detective!

*7...*

**13 life:** That's not true at all. It's just that we knew you'd definitely let me live.

*6...*

**8 EvilDetective:** I don't understand.

*5...*

**13 life:** You were wrong, Vitaly. Because the forger who fleed on the first night, and was replaced by Sanjit, **had managed to make a shield**.

*4...*

**8 EvilDetective:** No... No... What the hell is this...

*3...*

**13 life:** The second night, Sanjit gave me a shield. The third night he made a sword, and the fourth night he gave it to me.

*2...*

**8 EvilDetective:** No...

*1...*

**13 life:** GAME OVER.

With those words, Life threw the sword at Vitaly. The evil detective died.

**The villagers won.**

**13 EvilDetective:** NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!
