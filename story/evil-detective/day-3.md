### DAY 3

Night fell. The werewolves killed the medium, whose number was 11. He, in his turn, guessed that he could die, so he revived 12, the red lady. The evil detective killed two players this time: 2, the villager, and 6, the nightmare werewolf.

**13 life:** Was in a deep sleep.

**13 life:** I wonder why the nightmare werewolf didn't nightmare me last night. I already thought he isn't in the game.

**8 EvilDetective:** He was in the game from the beginning. And didn't nightmare you because the werewolves knew you'd check me out, and since I'm a headhunter, he'll always be equal to me.

**13 life:** Right.

**13 life:** 16, did you observe anyone who died?

**16 check_me:** Yeah.

**16 check_me:** 4 or 15 killed 11.

**15 disappointed:** I'm the bodyguard. 13, well, you know what I mean.

**13 life:** Sure. Thank you.

**15 disappointed:** Np.

**16 check_me:** For what?

**13 life:** For the claim.

**16 check_me:** Oh... All right...

**12 Koame:** By the way, I'd like to pass along some information from dead. 9 said he was the RRV forger. So if anyone else says they are RRV, they are lying.

**12 Koame:** 14 has gone offline, so his role is unknown.

**13 life:** Okay, thank you.

**13 life:** But I think we're going to lose. We're now down to 3 villagers against 2 werewolves and evil detective. And there's a headhunter whose victim isn't dead.

**8 EvilDetective:** Why? There's only one werewolf left.

**16 check_me:** One?

**8 EvilDetective:** Yeah. It was 14. Where do you think a second werewolf would come from? Only 4 and 6 didn't claim their roles. 4 is the junior werewolf, 6 is the evil detective.

**16 check_me:** Well, then we win!

**8 EvilDetective:** Congratulations.

Everyone voted 4. But after a while, she wrote:

**4 Lamiena:** Do you seriously think it's exactly what he says it is?

**16 check_me:** How could it not be?

**4 Lamiena:** How... Completely! There are two werewolves in the game! And 14 was the headhunter!

**8 EvilDetective:** What else can you imagine to stay alive?

**4 Lamiena:** I'm telling the whole truth.

**8 EvilDetective:** Then tell me, 4: if things are exactly as you say, why aren't we all voting together to kill some villager? 13 is my target, yes, so we could all vote for, lets say, 16. I would help the werewolves win because I don't want the villagers to win. But for some reason, that's not happening. For some reason, I don't do it. But why? Because you are the last werewolf!

**4 Lamiena:**: Damn fraud! You miserable liar!

**4 Lamiena:** Villagers, come to your senses. There are 2 werewolves in the game. If you kill me, you will have no chance because the evil detective wins. See for yourself. You kill me, I take one with me, and at night the last werewolf and the evil detective each kill one villager. And then you lose. And the evil detective will most likely win.

**16 check_me:** 4, so many amazing things have happened this game. You're just trying to pass off the current situation as the same as the previous ones. But nothing's gonna save you. We're going to win.

**4 Lamiena:** He told you the number. Why didn't you think about what it might mean? Why didn't you pay any attention to it?

**8 EvilDetective:** Very good, 4, very good. Now answer me this question, who will you take when you die?

**4 Lamiena:** Who do you think?

**8 EvilDetective:** I think you'll make the right choice. Because you want the outcome of this game.

Ten seconds have passed and time has expired.

**4 Lamiena:** Good luck.

The villagers killed 4, the junior werewolf. 15 died along with her. But when his role was revealed, what everyone saw came as a surprise. As everyone might have thought, Sanjit was a bodyguard, which is what he said.

**But it turned out he was the forger.**
